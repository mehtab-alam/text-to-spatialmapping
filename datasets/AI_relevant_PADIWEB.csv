Sabah Agriculture and Food Industries minister Junz Wong said this was to prevent the spread of the virus outside of the contaminated area.
However, he did not specify how many stocks or which countries are affected by the export halt.
“For Brunei, they themselves requested to stop the import of our poultry following this incident,” Wong said during a press conference on Monday (Aug 13).
A total of three chickens from two villages in Tuaran have been detected with the bird flu virus.
Meanwhile, villagers whose poultry have been culled following the detection of bird flu in Tuaran will be compensated.
Wong said villagers reared chicken mostly for their own consumption, and the culling has caused them losses.
""So, we will be compensating the affected villagers accordingly,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, he said poultry farmers would not be compensated as such because they knew the risks when venturing into the industry.
Almost 30,000 chicken and poultry have been destroyed after the detection of the virus.
Wong also said that the bird flu virus is believed to have originated from imported chickens, which were used in illegal cock-fighting activities.
On other matters, Sabah will have a standard operating procedure (SOP) to streamline the processing of bird's nests for export to China.
“We want things done directly from Sabah and not have to go through Peninsular Malaysia,” he said, adding this move is expected to benefit locals.
Wong said those interested to venture into the bird's nests business can go to his ministry to get their application forms.

irrelevant,6LEO8AYETF,New avian influenza indemnity rule finalized,https://www.feedstuffs.com/news/new-avian-influenza-indemnity-rule-finalized,Feedstuffs,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) issued a final rule Aug. 14 outlining the conditions under which USDA will pay indemnity to farms affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).
The industry welcomed the rule. Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, said, ""We look forward to reviewing the final rule and hope this ensures timely indemnification payments for our growers and companies in the event of disease outbreak.""
Related: APHIS proposes changes to National Poultry Improvement PlanChad Gregory, president and chief executive officer of the United Egg Producers (UEP), explained that the HPAI outbreak in 2015 was devastating for America’s egg farmers and for the industry overall. “United Egg Producers and its farmer-members take very seriously our responsibilities for biosecurity and disease prevention,” Gregory said.
Gregory said UEP, which represents about 90% of the nation’s egg production, recognized the critical need to provide industry leadership on the issue of indemnity. “Our organization created a dedicated Animal Health & Biosecurity Task Force to work closely with the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) to establish specific biosecurity principles, and we are pleased these principles are the foundation for audits in the final indemnity rule.”
Related: USDA changes avian flu indemnity payments“Egg farmers remain firmly committed to maintaining robust biosecurity practices on our farms to protect the health and well-being of our hens. We appreciate USDA-APHIS’s efforts in working with U.S. egg producers to ensure that comprehensive indemnities and compensation are available in the event of an HPAI outbreak,” Gregory added.
Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation welcomes USDA’s rule. ""America’s turkey farmers need more certainty when it comes to dealing with the devastating effects of HPAI, and this final rule provides clear guidance for poultry growers should they need to utilize the system. Additionally, the rule further emphasizes the focus of NTF and our membership on ensuring biosecurity remains a top priority for the industry,”  he said in a statement to Feedstuffs.
USDA said this final rule updates its February 2016 interim rule. First, it allows indemnity payments to be split between poultry and egg owners and their contracted growers and provides a formula for the split. The split payments for HPAI in the final rule are in line with the split payments for indemnity in the existing low-pathogenic avian influenza program.
APHIS said it apportions indemnity payments between owner and contractor based on the terms of the contract between the two parties and the duration of the period during which the contractor possessed the birds or eggs. Thus, the amount of the indemnity the contractor receives from APHIS will depend largely on the terms of the contract, APHIS said.
The Animal Health Protection Act only authorizes payment of indemnity to owners and contract growers of diseased birds or eggs that are destroyed and not to owners or contractors whose premises were indirectly affected.
The final rule also adopts biosecurity principles established by the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP), a cooperative state, federal and industry program for controlling certain poultry diseases that developed a set of 14 biosecurity principles. USDA published the 14 principles in May 2017, and they now serve as the minimum biosecurity principles that any poultry operation should follow.  
In the final rule, USDA addressed concerns stakeholders raised about the interim rule, including whether self-certification of biosecurity was adequate. As a result, USDA is now requiring audits to ensure that large poultry facilities practiced optimal biosecurity.
In the final rule, a facility that meets the minimum size requirements must have an auditable biosecurity plan. To be eligible for HPAI indemnity, the plan must address all 14 biosecurity principles in compliance with NPIP requirements.
Facilities will be audited at least once every two years or a sufficient number of times during that period to satisfy their Official State Agency. The audit will include, but may not be limited to, an evaluation of the biosecurity plan itself and documentation showing that the plan is being implemented.
“While it is true that weak biosecurity on a farm of any size could lead to spread of disease, the farms that were affected during the 2014-2015 outbreak were overwhelming large commercial facilities,” APHIS noted.
APHIS said approximately 18,900 operations will be subject to the biosecurity statement requirement out of the 233,770 poultry producers in the U.S. Those 18,900 operations, however, produce or house approximately 99% of the poultry in the U.S, APHIS said in the final rule.
“Exempting the smaller facilities, therefore, allows us to focus our resources on the operations that raise or house 99% of the nation’s poultry supply. While bird density on some smaller operations may be high enough to pose a risk of spreading HPAI due to environmental contamination when biosecurity is lacking, as noted above, 99% of the nation’s poultry reside and are raised on non-exempt operations,” the final rule explained.
While the loss of any size flock adversely affects the contractor, all flocks that were infected by HPAI during the 2014-15 outbreak were completely depopulated, including those owned by large-scale producers, APHIS explained. During the 2014-15 HPAI outbreak, 21 backyard flocks were infected, totaling approximately 10,000 birds, versus 211 commercial flocks totaling approximately 50 million birds. “In the aggregate, then, the impact on large commercial producers was much greater,” APHIS said in its rule.
APHIS's indemnity calculation formulas are the means by which APHIS determines the fair market value of birds and eggs destroyed due to HPAI and, thereby, the total amount of compensation due the indemnified party. This rule did not make any changes to that formula as addressing these calculators is beyond the scope of the current rule-making, APHIS said.",2018-08-15 05:00:00.000000,irrelevant,

The case involved a 42-year-old man from Laibin in Guangxi. He developed symptoms on August 10 and was hospitalized on August 15. He is now in a serious condition. The patient had contact with live poultry before the onset of symptoms.
avian influenza prevention/CHP
From 2014 to date, 20 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities. This is the third case reported in Guangxi province since late 2016.
Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks. Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days. The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient. People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.
V-Box – 5 Panel Vaginal Health Test Pack
To prevent contracting avian influenza, health officials offer the following recommendations:

Avoid touching poultry, birds, animals or their droppings;
When buying live chickens, do not touch them and their droppings. Do not blow at their bottoms. Wash eggs with detergent if soiled with faecal matter and cook and consume the eggs immediately. Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling chickens and eggs;
Eggs should be cooked well until the white and yolk become firm. Do not eat raw eggs or dip cooked food into any sauce with raw eggs. Poultry should be cooked thoroughly. If there is pinkish juice running from the cooked poultry or the middle part of its bone is still red, the poultry should be cooked again until fully done;
Wash hands frequently, especially before touching the mouth, nose or eyes, before handling food or eating, and after going to the toilet, touching public installations or equipment such as escalator handrails, elevator control panels or door knobs, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing; and
Wear a mask if fever or respiratory symptoms develop, when going to a hospital or clinic, or while taking care of patients with fever or respiratory symptoms.

Background
Aug 29, 2018

Bird flu season fast approaching

An outbreak of avian influenza on a Russian poultry farm has left producers across Europe looking nervously towards the east as winter in the Northern Hemisphere approaches.

Authorities confirmed a site housing almost 500,000 birds in the Kostromskaya region in north western Russia was infected with H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza. The virus belongs to the Asia lineage of H5 high path strain that has been in outbreaks across Asia, Africa and Europe since 2014. 
It follows 67 outbreaks of H5 avian influenza in several regions of western Russia this summer. 
An assessment by the UK government said that if the source was wild birds then their migratory paths could see farms across northern Europe at risk. 
The site of this latest outbreak is overlapped by three migration flyways, one of which brings birds into Europe.
Whatever the source, it is important at this time of year to review biosecurity on farms, and considering the risk points and vulnerabilities that your poultry business may have. Last year was a relatively quiet one for European producers when it comes to avian influenza, but that’s no reason to suggest this one won’t be.

Slaughter the local pigs in a different slaughterhouse and the mainland [Chinese] pigs have their own chain.”Hong Kong imports about 4,000 live pigs a day from the mainland, while about 290 pigs are supplied daily by local farms.The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned on Tuesday the rapid onset of African swine fever in China, and its detection in areas more than 1,000km apart, could mean the deadly pig virus may spread to other Asian countries at any time.There have been four outbreaks of the highly contagious swine disease on the mainland this month. It was first reported on August 3 in the northeastern city of Shenyang. The virus causes a haemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in pigs. The most virulent forms are lethal in 100 per cent of infected animals.It can be spread by eating the product or through direct contact with secretions from the infected pig, but it does not affect people. The virus can persist for long periods in uncooked pig products.“We don’t know what the situation is,” Pfeiffer said. “What we know is we’ve had four outbreaks of the virus that have been reported in almost four weeks, but like many outbreaks, the question is how many other farms and animals are already infected.”Pfeiffer, who is with the college’s department of infectious diseases and public health, said Hong Kong authorities needed to do their utmost to keep the virus out of the city given no cure or vaccine for it exists.Live pigs for local consumption are sourced from registered farms in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, which come under the supervision and monitoring of the mainland authorities, a spokesman for the Centre for Food Safety said.“Every consignment of pigs [for food] must be accompanied by an official certificate attesting that the animals are healthy and showed no clinical sign of infectious diseases,” the spokesman added.Consignments are also inspected at the border and at slaughterhouses.The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reminded local pig farmers to step up biosecurity measures, a spokesman said.The department will continue to communicate with mainland authorities about the disease and “stay vigilant to monitor” its risk.A small number of breeding pigs are also imported into Hong Kong each year from Guangdong. They must be accompanied by an official health certificate issued by the mainland authority. The animals are inspected by the department’s officers upon arrival and are quarantined thereafter.China is a major pig-producing country and accounts for about half the global population of pigs, estimated at 500 million, the FAO said.Dr Howard Wong Kai-hay, director for professional development at City University’s college of veterinary medicine, agreed Hong Kong should be prepared as an outbreak of African swine fever in pork would be “a much bigger disrupter of communities than chickens”.“We should always be prepared, we should always have the option so we should know what to do,” Wong said.Story continuesIn previous years, the city has culled thousands of chickens due to avian flu scares.Pfeiffer and Wong believed the veterinary school could help officials design measures to help prevent the introduction of the virus and conduct risk assessment.With proper risk assessment, it should be possible to come up with ways to minimise the risk to Hong KongDr Howard Wong Kai-hay, City University“Hong Kong does not have a porous border with China,” Wong said. “With proper risk assessment, it should be possible to come up with ways to minimise the risk to Hong Kong and then that has to be taken up by the government.”The Post reported on Monday that agricultural officers across China had been ordered to control the spread of African swine fever.Pfeiffer, who has been researching the virus since 2005, said it could have spread out of Africa by infected food waste from ships or airliners that had been sold to pig farms.“It’s an animal disease, but because of the social issues, it’s about food supply, people’s livelihoods,” he added.The strain detected in China is similar to one that infected pigs in eastern Russia in 2017.“The movement of pig products can spread diseases quickly and, as in this case of African swine fever, it’s likely that the movement of such products, rather than live pigs, has caused the spread of the virus to other parts of China,” FAO’s chief veterinarian Juan Lubroth said.This article Swine fever outbreak prompts call to slaughter Hong Kong pigs separately from imported mainland Chinese livestock first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2018.",2018-08-29 05:00:00.000000,irrelevant,

CDFA explained that poultry “flu” season has arrived as natural, asymptomatic carriers of avian influenza — waterfowl — migrate over California. As can occur at this time of year, LPAI was confirmed in a commercial turkey flock in Stanislaus County on Sept. 11, and subsequently, a second commercial turkey flock was found to have the same LPAI strain within the 10 km surveillance zone established around the initial flock.
While the initial flock did not show notable signs of avian influenza, as a part of proactive flock health care, CDFA said the company veterinarian submitted samples to the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory for disease testing. That lab diagnosed the samples as presumptive positive for LPAI H7, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the virus as North American wild bird lineage LPAI H7N3.
CDFA and USDA took action, working closely with poultry producers and veterinarians in the area to test other flocks for disease and limit additional introductions and spread. Under veterinary supervision, depopulation and disposal of infected and exposed poultry on the initial property have been completed.
CDFA said during surveillance of commercial premises within this zone, a second commercial facility with meat turkeys, also in Stanislaus County, was confirmed positive for LPAI H7N3, and partial sequencing of the virus was consistent with the initial case.
Another 10 km surveillance zone has been established around the second property. CDFA said nine commercial premises within the 10 km surveillance zones surrounding both infected premises have tested negative for avian influenza so far.

neg,D6KOIN0VOT,Distemper virus appears to be the culprit in the deaths of hundreds of seals,https://www.pressherald.com/2018/09/21/distemper-outbreak-is-suspected-in-seal-die-off/,Portland Press Herald,"An ongoing mass die-off of seals along the New England coast has been linked to an outbreak of a distemper virus.
Almost 1,000 stranded seals have been reported along the coastline in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts since July. As of last week, three-quarters of the seals were dead, according to figures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The remaining seals were reported as live strandings and were likely sick.
The agency reported Friday that the main pathogen found in most of the dead seals tested was phocine distemper virus, a disease especially virulent among harbor seals, one of the most common marine mammals on the U.S. East Coast.
Phocine distemper is similar to canine distemper and measles. It affects the respiratory, gastrointestinal and nervous systems of mammals, suppressing immune systems and leaving the animals vulnerable to other infections or disease. Distemper cannot be transferred to humans, but may affect pets, NOAA said.
Some of the dead seals tested since the start of the die-off were infected with avian influenza, but further testing did not provide strong evidence it is the cause of the die-off, the agency added.
“We are continuing additional testing to identify any other factors that may be involved in this event and will share those findings when available,” NOAA said in an online statement.
While a viral infection may be the immediate cause of the die-off, some researchers believe decades of chemical pollution that jeopardizes the immune systems of marine mammals is an underlying cause.
Kat King, left, and Katie Gilbert, interns from Marine Mammals of Maine, examine the body of a seal that washed up on Aug. 17 at Scarborough Beach State Park. Distemper virus is now suspected as the cause of hundreds of seals’ deaths along the New England coast. 
Reports of dead seals found on Maine beaches have come in at a relentless pace since July and show no signs of slowing down.
“We’ve always had to deal with dead seals occasionally, this is the first year we’ve seen anything like this. It is insane,” said Jackie LaLiberte, the animal control office in Wells. The police department regularly gets more than 10 calls a week from people who have found deceased seals while walking on the beach, LaLiberte said. She responded to six calls for stranded seals on Friday.
“We get a lot of calls, it has not changed, whether it is the busy part of the summer or here at the end of September,” she said. “I think my job has turned from animal control to seal removal.”
DESIGNATED AN UNUSUAL MORTALITY EVENT
Phocine distemper was discovered in seals during an outbreak off the coasts of northern Europe, the United Kingdom and Ireland in 1988. An estimated 20,000 harbor seals died during that event, nearly 60 percent of the population, according to research from the early 1990s. Distemper was linked to another die-off of least 30,000 seals in the Baltic, North and Wadden seas in 2002.
The virus also was blamed for the most significant die-off on the East Coast in almost 30 years. In 2006 and 2007, at least 1,500 harbor and gray seals were stranded in an outbreak along the coast from Maine to Virginia.
If the current trend holds, the number of seals deaths this year has the potential to come close to, or surpass, that event. Responders reported 999 stranded seals in New England between July and this week. Three quarters of the animals were found on southern Maine beaches, especially in communities south of Portland.
Close to 500 seals were found stranded in New England in August, almost nine times the five-year monthly average. So far this month, 336 more seals have been found, NOAA said.
In late August, the federal agency designated the die-off an unusual mortality event, authorizing a special investigation into its cause and possible reimbursement for rescue organizations such as Marine Mammals of Maine that respond to dead and stranded seals.
WEAK HERD IMMUNITY A FACTOR
Scientists aren’t sure why harbor seals seem susceptible to distemper, but believe that weak herd immunity makes episodic outbreaks worse.
“There are always low levels of animals in the population that have the virus and pass it on but aren’t dying,” said Tracey Goldstein, a specialist in marine mammal disease at the University of California Davis. Her lab is testing samples taken from New England seals that have died in the last three months.
“The longer you are past an outbreak, the fewer animals there are with an antibody,” Goldstein said. “The population as a whole doesn’t have immunity or protection from the virus.”
Gray seals, on the other hand, appear to be more resilient to distemper. That means they can carry the virus without getting too sick or dying, but can also pass it on to harbor seals during the spring breeding season, when lots of animals from both species congregate on beaches.
If a virus takes hold in harbor seals, it can spread rapidly, Goldstein said.
“For whatever reason, they are really susceptible to the virus, when they are exposed they are really unable to fight off the infection,” she said.
What effect this outbreak may have on the northeastern harbor seal population isn’t certain. There are approximately 76,000 seals in a population from the Bay of Fundy to New York, and the most recent federal stock assessment said the population was stable.
Onshore seal strandings represent a small proportion of the animals affected, so it isn’t clear how many seals may have succumbed to the virus, Goldstein said.
The massive European outbreaks of phocine distemper in 1988 and 2002 killed half of the population or more, but seals quickly rebounded, she added.
“If the population is strong and remains strong, it shouldn’t have a long-term effect,” Goldstein said.

In Stanislaus County, Cal., CDFA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have been testing flocks in a 10 km zone around an initial case of LPAI H7N3 in commercial turkeys. A second flock was detected earlier in September, and both flocks have been euthanized and disposed of to stop further spread, CDFA said.
Related: California urges biosecurity reviews following low-path avian flu discoveriesOn Sept. 23, CDFA said two more flocks were identified within the 10 km zone that tested positive for LPAI H7N3: one commercial organic turkey flock and one small mixed poultry organic flock. Of the four cases, CDFA said three were participating in the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP), which is a cooperative industry, state and federal program established to test and monitor several poultry diseases, including avian influenza.
CDFA said the other 18 flocks in the 10 km zone continue to test negative for avian influenza.
California's other ongoing poultry health situation has been virulent Newcastle disease virus in exhibition birds in counties in southern California. CDFA and USDA have been conducting enhanced surveillance and epidemiological investigations of the Newcastle outbreak.
On Sept. 28, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) issued a notice that USDA and CDFA had detected the virus at a live bird market in Los Angeles County, Cal. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls, OIE said, and the market has been depopulated, cleaned and disinfected. Live bird markets in the area have been ordered to close for a day to perform cleaning and disinfection with environmental sampling, the OIE notice said.
Virulent Newcastle disease, formerly known as exotic Newcastle disease, is a contagious and fatal viral disease affecting the respiratory, nervous and digestive systems of birds and poultry. The disease is so virulent that many birds and poultry die without showing any clinical signs, USDA said.
Virulent Newcastle disease is not a food safety concern. No human cases of Newcastle disease have ever occurred from eating poultry products. Properly cooked poultry products are safe to eat. In very rare instances, people working directly with sick birds can become infected with mild symptoms.
Since May 18, USDA has confirmed 147 cases of Newcastle disease in backyard birds in California: 95 in San Bernardino County, 21 in Riverside County, 30 in Los Angeles County and 1 in Ventura County.
Biosecurity
For both avian influenza and Newcastle disease, regardless of location, it is essential that all bird owners follow good biosecurity practices to help protect their birds from infectious diseases, USDA said. These simple steps include:
* Washing hands and scrubbing boots before and after entering an area with birds;
* Cleaning and disinfecting tires and equipment before moving them off the property, and
* Isolating any birds returning from shows for 30 days before placing them with the rest of the flock.
All bird owners should report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA’s toll-free number at (866) 536-7593.
On CDFA's commercial poultry biosecurity webpage, the agency says disease risk cannot be completely eliminated from a poultry premises. Well before a disease outbreak event, premises management personnel, in consultation with a veterinarian, should conduct a biosecurity risk assessment of all facilities they manage and the biosecurity practices at each location. It is important to evaluate the level of risk and then determine measures needed to address and improve the risk areas of concern -- in advance of a possible avian disease outbreak.
CDFA has a guide that gives poultry producers or farm managers the opportunity to assess their current level of on-farm biosecurity. Answers will provide an idea of where areas of weakness exist on an operation that require attention or practices that fall below current industry standards. Each response in the guide is rated as Minimal Biosecurity Risk, Medium Biosecurity Risk or High Biosecurity Risk.

Recent findings suggest that the vaccine largely worked but detected two new genetic variations of the H7N9 and H7N2 subtypes in unvaccinated ducks. These findings have been published in the journal Cell Host & Microbe on September 27.<br />\""It surprised me that the novel, highly pathogenic subtypes had been generated in and adapted so well to ducks, because the original highly pathogenic form of H7N9 has very limited capacity to replicate in ducks,\"" says Hualan Chen, a senior author on the paper and an animal virologist at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute.<br />To prevent further human infection, Chen and her team believe that the virus should be eliminated in ducks as soon as possible<br />Chen\'s team collected over 37,928 chickens and 15,956 duck genetic samples 8 months before and 5 months after the vaccine\'s introduction. They isolated 304 H7N9 viruses before the vaccine\'s release, and only 17 H7N9 viruses and one H7N2 virus after.<br />How the virus spread to ducks\""Our data show that vaccination of chickens successfully prevented the spread of the H7N9 virus in China,\"" says Chen. \""The fact that human infection has not been detected since February 2018 indicates that consumers of poultry have also been well-protected from H7N9 infection.\""<br />The bird flu virus replicates in host cells and often mutates and reassorts over time. When Chen\'s team looked closely at the genetic types of the disease-causing strains in ducks, they found that an H7N2 and an H7N9 virus had picked up certain gene segments from other duck influenza viruses, improving their ability to infect ducks.<br />\""Influenza viruses mutate as long as they replicate, but it\'s very difficult to predict when the H7N9 virus will obtain a particular harmful mutation,\"" says Chen. \""It is possible that the virus may adapt in other species in the future if it cannot be eliminated soon.\""<br />To prevent further human infection, Chen and her team believe that the virus should be eliminated in ducks as soon as possible.<br />\""Fortunately, our study indicates that the current vaccine will work well in ducks, so we do not need to develop a new one,\"" says Chen. \""We suggest applying the H7 vaccine in ducks immediately.\""",2018-09-28 11:41:48.000000,done,

Pinnipeds are a group of aquatic mammals that include seals, which are the species affected by this recent UME.<br />Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, a UME is defined as a \""stranding event that is unexpected, involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population and demands immediate response.\"" Over the last few months, the number of stranded (live and dead) seals has been regionally significant.<br />Since July, there have been 1,036 seals reported stranded along the New England coast. Just over 750 seal illnesses and deaths were recorded in Maine, 110 in New Hampshire and 171 in Massachusetts. The most common seal species affected has been harbor seals, though some grey seals have also been involved.<br />All seals seen in the wild should be left alone. <br />- Albert O. Fischer<br />Scientists believe that the source of the die-off is phocine distemper virus, though they also found some seals that tested positive for avian influenza, which isn\'t suspected to have directly caused the mortalities.<br />Phocine distemper virus is a type of morbillivirus, the genus of viruses that include the familiar measles virus in humans, canine distemper in dogs, coyotes and wolves, rinderpest in cattle and peste-des-petit-ruminants in sheep and goats.<br />For seals found alive, symptoms of distemper include lethargy, coughing and sneezing, discharge from the eyes and nose, seizures, skin abscesses and poor body condition. Death can result from this virus and its effects, since it also suppresses the immune system, making the animals more susceptible to other infections and diseases.<br />Luckily, phocine distemper is not zoonotic, meaning it cannot be transferred to humans. However, dogs might be receptive, so for all those beach dog walkers, remember to keep your dog leashed or at least away from injured or dead seals. It also cannot be transferred to fish, so consumption of those bass and blues is not restricted.<br />This most recent outbreak is not the first time that seals have faced this epidemic. Phocine distemper was found on this side of the Atlantic in seals off Long Island, N.Y. in 1992, and in 2006 and 2007, the east coast population of seals lost about 1,500 animals to distemper. The disease is spread through inhalation and direct contact between seals.<br />Mortalities can be significant. A large outbreak off the northern European coast killed 20,000 animals or 60 per cent of the population in the affected area in 1998; and 30,000 seals died in an outbreak in the Baltic, North and Wadden Seas in 2002.<br />Unfortunately, researchers in Maine have linked the die-off to \""decades of chemical pollution that made the sea\'s population vulnerable to toxins and disease.\"" They note that PCBs are found in these animals\' livers and blubber, creatures that they describe as having been \""born polluted.\""<br />Although Benjamin Franklin insisted that one not \""go to the doctor with every distemper, nor to the lawyer with every quarrel, nor to the pot for every thirst,\"" you might be the first to find a sick or dead animal and should be the first to call NOAA about it. Furthermore, if you see a seal on the beach, remember not to get too close; and that applies even if the seal is healthy.<br />There is cause for hope, though, that while some individuals\' fates are sealed, not all seals are similarly fated. This outbreak is sad and troubling, but as the nineteenth-century philosopher George Henry Lewes advised: \""The only cure for grief is action.\""<br />Suzan Bellincampi is director of the Felix Neck Wildlife Sanctuary in Edgartown, and author of Martha\'s Vineyard: A Field Guide to Island Nature.",2018-10-02 13:52:57.000000,done,

FILE PHOTO: A duck is seen in its enclosure at a poultry farm in Doazit, Southwestern France, December 17, 2015. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoFrance, which has one of the largest poultry flocks in the European Union, is one of the countries that was most affected by the H5N8 bird flu virus that spread through wild birds across the continent last year. Producers had to cull more than four million birds after the virus spread throughout the southwest of the country, prompting France to halt output in the region and implement a series of protection measures to avoid a new crisis. \""The sector seems far more robust now. Of course some cases may break out at any time but by no means we will be in the same situation, we\'ll be able to deal with it very quickly,\"" Marie-Pierre Pe, director of French foie gras makers group CIFOG, told reporters. Bird flu outbreaks generally arise in the autumn in the European Union, carried by migrating wild birds coming from the East. Many farmers had to build extra premises to confine ducks when they are most at risk of contracting the virus and invest in new equipment such as cleaning tools. FILE PHOTO: A Mulard duck is being fed by an employee at a poultry farm in Doazit, Southwestern France, December 17, 2015. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File PhotoThe industry passed these costs on to customers in prices. Although output fell 20 percent in volume last year, sales rose by 2.8 percent in value in the \""festive season\"" ranging from mid-November to mid-February, due mainly to the higher costs, Pe said. CIFOG, which also represents duck meat producers, expects 2018 output to come back to volumes close to those produced before the 2016 bird flu crisis. \""Biosecurity measures that were put in place have borne fruit,\"" she said. Bird flu also hurt sales abroad of foie gras in the past two years, as major importers such as Japan shut their borders. Most countries, apart from Taiwan, have since reopened their markets but a return to normal will take time, Pe said. Foie gras is made from the livers of geese or ducks that have been fattened with grain, usually by force feeding. Sold whole or as a pate, it is considered a gourmet food in both Western and Asian cuisine. The practice of force-feeding has often been criticized as cruel by animal rights activists.

The World Organization for Animal Health said routine surveillance testing confirmed on Monday the presence of a low-pathogenic N5N2 virus in a flock of 40,000 turkeys in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota’s top turkey producing county. The virus originated in wild birds. The state Board of Animal Health said only one of four barns on the farm, housing 10,000, 13-week-old toms, was affected.
The flock has been quarantined but has shown no signs of illness, the agencies said. The farm will be allowed to market the birds normally in a few weeks once the flock tests negative, said Dr. Shauna Voss, senior veterinarian at the board’s poultry testing laboratory in Willmar.
The board has stepped up surveillance at nearby poultry farms as a precaution.
The virus is different from the highly pathogenic H5N2 virus that caused a massive outbreak in U.S. turkeys and chickens in 2015, which resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million birds. Iowa and Minnesota were by far the hardest hit states. Losses across the U.S. economy were estimated at $3.3 billion.
Voss said this was the first detection of any avian influenza virus in commercial poultry in Minnesota since that outbreak, although there was a low-pathogenic case in western Wisconsin last year.
The 2015 outbreak led to tighter biosecurity measures on poultry farms to protect them from outside sources of infection, such as wild birds, rodents and farm workers who might track in viruses on their footwear or clothing. Producers now conduct enhanced surveillance during the spring and fall migrations, Voss said.
The new detection shows that those security measures have paid off, she said.

MINNEAPOLIS — Authorities report an outbreak of a mild form of bird flu in turkeys in Kandiyohi County of west-central Minnesota.
The World Organization for Animal Health says routine surveillance testing confirmed on Monday the presence of a low pathogenic N5N2 virus in a flock of 40,000 turkeys in Minnesota's top turkey-producing county. The virus originated in wild birds.
Previous avian flu coverage

Bird flu cost Iowa's economy $1.2 billion
Farmers wiped out by bird flu struggle to rebuild
Millions of hens euthanized at Iowa farms

The affected flock has been quarantined, but has shown no signs of illness. The farm will be allowed to market the birds.
The virus is different from the highly pathogenic H5N2 virus that caused a massive outbreak in U.S. turkeys and chickens in 2015, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 million birds. Iowa and Minnesota were the hardest hit states. The outbreak led to tighter biosecurity on poultry farms.",2018-10-23 05:00:00.000000,done,

California update
Meanwhile in California, a commercial turkey flock in Stanislaus County, Cal., experiencing some increase in mortality and respiratory symptoms submitted samples in early October to the California Animal Health & Food Safety Laboratory.
According to the California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA), the laboratory reported presumptive positive for H7 avian influenza on Oct. 9, and it was confirmed by NVSL as LPAI H7N3 on Oct. 11. This brings the total number of infected flocks in California to five: four commercial flock participants in the National Poultry Improvement Plan, and one flock not in the plan, CDFA said.
A surveillance zone of approximately 10 km has been established around the detection sites of LPAI. CDFA and USDA continue to work closely with poultry producers and veterinarians in the areas around affected premises to test other flocks for avian influenza and limit additional introductions and spread.
CDFA said the first three affected flocks were euthanized and disposed of to eliminate the virus and control the disease, but plans for the fourth and fifth affected flocks are being evaluated to determine the most appropriate way to stop further spread.",2018-10-24 05:00:00.000000,done,

The case involved a 44-year-old man from Hechi in Guangxi. He developed symptoms on October 18, was hospitalized on October 21 and died on October 27. The patient denied that he had contact with live poultry before the onset of symptoms.
From 2014 to date, 22 human cases of avian influenza A(H5N6) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities.
Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.
Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.
People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.",2018-10-31 06:00:00.000000,"irrelevant, human case",

The Minnesota Board of Animal Health on Thursday identified H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza in a Stearns County turkey flock 
The board, in a press release, said this is not the same virus that caused the 2015 avian influenza outbreak, and this strain does not pose a risk to public health or food safety.
The virus was detected during a routine test, according to Dale Lauer, director of the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory and an assistant director with the board. All poultry flocks are tested before they are moved to market as part of a program to detect any evidence of avian influenza.
""We test all of our poultry flocks before they go to market and before processing, so this is part of a routine surveillance that we do year-round,"" Lauer said.

The flock of 13-week-old hens has been quarantined and will be tested and monitored until the board determines the flock is virus-negative, according to the release.
""We quarantine the flock, and none of those birds move off the farm,"" Lauer said. ""We allow the birds to recover. Like when people get the flu, we tell them to stay at home, take some medicine and just lay low. That's what we do with these flocks as well.""
The impacted turkeys will be allowed to move to market with approval from the board once they have recovered and test virus-negative for the disease, the release said.
""We will continue to monitor this particular flock in Stearns County and we do that weekly,"" Lauer said. ""Once the virus stops shedding and the flock is clinically normal, they go to market.""
This is the second case of avian influenza detected this year. A turkey flock in Kandiyohi County was confirmed positive for H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza in late October.
But this is not the same strain of the virus that impacted more than 9 million birds in Minnesota in the spring of 2015.
Lauer said this year's strain has North American origins, while the 2015 virus was a Eurasian strain. Testing at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the origins of this year's strain.
Because the virus is low-pathogenic, it is not killing birds and the board is taking a quarantine approach after detecting the virus instead of destroying flocks.
""That's an important distinction. This is a different virus than what we had in 2015,"" said Steve Olson, executive director of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association and the Chicken and Egg Association of Minnesota. ""It's low-pathogenic, meaning it's not virulent and it's not killing birds.""

The discovery of the virus has put producers on ""elevated alert,"" Olson said in an interview Thursday. Farmers are implementing additional surveillance to detect anymore signs of the virus.
But because of seasonal wild bird migration, producers are always more vigilant against avian influenza this time of year.
""That's what we do every fall and spring, because the wild birds have been the resivor for this virus and for other diseases,"" Olson said. ""When those wild birds are moving that's when we're on high-alert.""
Lauer said there is no risk to public health or food safety, and that the board will continue to monitor the situation.
""(The public) can go to their local grocery store and be assured that any poultry product, whether it's eggs, turkey, or chicken, is free of the influenzas virus because we have these programs in place,"" Lauer said.
Minnesota is the nation's largest turkey producer, and Stearns County is the state's second-largest producer behind Kandiyohi County.",2018-11-01 06:00:00.000000,done,

All flocks are tested for influenza before they are moved to market, and this finding was part of the everyday process of ensuring a safe food supply and protecting Minnesota’s poultry industry from the spread of influenza, MBAH said. The flock of 13-week-old hens has been quarantined and will be tested and monitored until the board determines the flock is virus negative and the turkeys can be controlled marketed.

Biosecurity is the key defense for commercial poultry flocks and is part of the reason why cases have not happened in more flocks, MBAH said. Biosecurity is the way flocks are managed and the various practices put in place to isolate flocks from outside sources of infection. Biosecurity is very important for protecting commercial poultry flocks and to prevent the spread of any disease. Backyard flock owners should practice strict biosecurity measures, including preventing birds from exposure to and/or commingling with wild birds and other types of poultry.
MBAH has a flyer on general biosecurity steps for producers available at this link.
For more than 40 years, commercial poultry flocks in Minnesota have been routinely tested for avian influenza prior to marketing. Avian influenza is not a food safety issue.

So far, 35 cases have been confirmed, and 10 people have died from the mosquito-borne disease.\""This outbreak is of concern since the population of Ethiopia is highly susceptible to yellow fever due to absence of recent exposure and lack of large-scale immunizations,\"" the WHO said in a Nov 2 report.Following an immediate reactive vaccination campaign conducted in mid-October, around 31,000 people have been vaccinated against yellow fever, and the country said it plans to introduce the yellow fever vaccine into a routine immunization schedule in 2020.Ethiopia previously experienced frequent yellow fever outbreaks until the 1960s, but there were no outbreaks of the virus until 2013, when the disease re-emerged in the same region with 143 cases. Nov 6 Reuters story Nov 2 WHO Africa regional reportPhase 2 trial shows chikungunya vaccine to be safe, immunogenicResults from a phase 2 trial of a live-attenuated, measles-vectored chikungunya vaccine (MV-CHIK) showed the vaccine to be safe, well-tolerated, and immunogenic, according to a study published yesterday in The Lancet that did not assess efficacy.Healthy adults ages 18 to 55 in Austria and Germany were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to receive MV-CHIK, measles vaccine used as a control, or priming with the measles vaccine, then MV-CHIK, in two different administration regimens. Researchers defined immunogenicity as the presence of neutralizing antibodies against chikungunya at day 56. A total of 263 volunteers participated in the study.According to the trial results, all participants in the MV-CHIK treatment groups produced neutralizing antibodies after one or two immunizations, with geometric mean titers ranging from 12.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.75-18.93) to 174.80 (95% CI, 119.10-256.50) and seroconversion rates ranging from 50.0% to 95.9%, depending on the dose and administration schedule.Though injection-site tenderness was widely reported among MV-CHIK recipients, no serious adverse events were recorded.\""We found that the MV-CHIK vaccine had a safety and tolerability profile that was similar to the measles control vaccine,\"" the authors concluded. \""On the basis of these data, we are preparing a phase 3 study of MV-CHIK,\"" which will assess vaccine protection against chikungunya infection.In a commentary on the study in the same issue, arboviral disease expert Ann M. Powers, PhD, of the US Centers for the Disease Control and Prevention, said, \""The approach has some distinct advantages over other platforms, including the use of a measles virus vector that has a long established use and safety record. Additionally, because the measles vector is viable, it should generate multiple rounds of chikungunya virus-like particles, which should enhance immunogenicity.\""She added, however, \""Curiously, the antibody titres generated in response to either a single or even a boost dose of the vaccine were at least an order of magnitude lower than those seen with other virus-like particle vaccine candidates. . . . The lower neutralising antibody titre with MV-CHIK might be an issue once an antibody threshold necessary for immunity has been established. One other limitation of MV-CHIK is the clear need for more than one dose of vaccine.\"" Nov 5 Lancet study Nov 5 Lancet commentaryRussia, Bulgaria report more high-path H5 avian flu outbreaksRussia and Bulgaria reported new highly pathogenic avian flu outbreaks in poultry, according to notifications today from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), as the WHO European regional office warned authorities and residents of countries located on wild bird migration routes to be vigilant about avian flu outbreaks.Russia\'s outbreak started Oct 31 at a commercial farm in Voronezh oblast in the far western part of the country. Testing detected an H5 strain, and the event killed 122,300 of 342,300 susceptible birds. The remaining ones were slated for culling as part of outbreak control measures.The country has reported a steady stream of H5 outbreaks since June, and it reported its last one on Oct 1.Meanwhile, Bulgaria, which has been battling a spate of H5N8 outbreaks, reported three more detections, one at a commercial farm in Plovdiv province and two in Haskovo province, two involving farms and the other backyard birds. The outbreaks began between Oct 29 and Oct 31, and, taken together, the virus killed 4,338 of 43,327 poultry. The surviving ones were destroyed to curb the spread of the virus.Nov 6 OIE report on H5 in Russia Nov 6 OIE report on H5N8 in BulgariaIn a statement today, the WHO\'s regional office for Europe pointed out that in autumn wild birds migrate southwest to overwinter in warmer climates. The agency noted that, since June, Russia has reported 80 highly pathogenic H5 outbreaks, one of them involving H5N2, along major bird migration routes. \""Given the presence of avian influenza viruses in the Region, their spread to other countries is likely,\"" the statement said.Russian officials said the most recent outbreak was caused by an H5N8 virus that is closely related to the strain that caused widespread outbreaks in Europe during the winter of 2016-17, resulting in millions of birds being culled and  large economic losses.

They protested outside the agency’s headquarters in Sofia this week, demanding leadership changes, saying that nearly a million birds had been destroyed since the beginning of the year.

Thousands of hatched birds had died because of the “unacceptable arbitrariness and inactivity of the agency.” Photo: VidiPhoto 

They say that thousands of hatched birds had died because of the “unacceptable arbitrariness and inactivity of the agency,” claiming that the sector is being targeted for obliteration.
Plamen Chelebiev, owner of one of the nation’s leading poultry companies, told Bulgarian National Radio that the agency had lost control of the situation.
22 bird flu outbreaks
“Right now, instead of destroying bird flu, they want to destroy our industry,” he said.
He was backed by Ivan Youchev, co-chair of the nation’s waterfowl farmers’ organisation, who said the agency had no clear rules. Dr Damyan Iliev, agency director, said at a news conference on Monday that the disease was continuing to spread. 
“At present, there are 22 bird flu outbreaks in Bulgaria – they were found in 5 poultry farms, 4 backyard farms, one bird in a game farm, and 12 waterfowl farms.
“The disease can be spread in many ways – through transportation, through people and so there is no way we can say that an industrial farms has bird flu just because of a grandmother’s hen house.”
Commenting on the claims of inactivity by the agency, Dr Iliev said the allegations needed to be proved, and if so, the agency would take measures.
He pointed out that farmers from the sector had received compensation totalling 4 million Leva.
Enhanced observation
The Agency said it had implemented a programme for enhanced observation of poultry farms in connection with the latest cases of bird flu, with measures including greater biosecurity on farms, more frequent laboratory control and prevention across the country.
The World Health Organisation this week warned that avian influenza could spread along wild birds’ migration routes this winter, urging vigilance. It pointed to outbreaks in the Russian Federation, saying that between mid-June and October 1 the Federation had reported 80 outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5 virus and one of H5N2 virus among domestic poultry.",2018-11-07 07:00:00.000000,"irrelevant, nonspecific",

 Published 4:37 PM EST Nov 28, 2018
 

More than a month after the first case of avian influenza was detected in Minnesota this year, officials from the Minnesota Board of Animal Health are lifting a quarantine on two Stearns County turkey farms.
The two flocks tested negative for H5N2 low pathogenic avian influenza, and the healthy, recovered birds have been controlled marketed, according to the board. This is part of the planned response to the outbreak.
Six flocks across Stearns and Kandiyohi counties remain under quarantine and are receiving weekly tests to determine when they can be controlled marketed.
Earlier: Avian influenza detected in Stearns County turkey flock
""We’re monitoring these flocks and once they've recovered and cleared the virus and all the tests are negative, we identify a plant they can go to,"" said Dr. Dale Lauer, director of the Minnesota Poultry Testing Laboratory in Willmar and an assistant director with the board.
""We have been monitoring them and they just haven't completely recovered,"" Lauer said. ""We've been able to still detect virus so they just have to sit a little longer.""
What we know about the impacted flocks
Avian influenza was detected in eight commercial turkey flocks in Minnesota this year. No new cases have been detected since Nov. 14.
So far, two infected flocks have tested negative for the virus and been controlled marketed:

Stearns County 1, detected Oct. 30 in a flock of 13-week-old hens.
Stearns County 2, detected Nov. 2 in a flock of 2-week-old and 13-week-old hens.

Six commercial turkey flocks remain quarantined and are being monitored for signs of infection. Controlled marketing is being planned once these flocks test negative for the influenza virus:

Kandiyohi County 1, detected Oct. 19 in a flock of 13-week-old toms.
Kandiyohi County 2, detected Nov. 2 in a flock of 16-week-old toms.
Stearns County 3, detected Nov. 3 in a flock of 8-week-old and 17-week-old hens.
Stearns County 4, detected Nov. 3 in a flock of 6-week-old and 14-week-old toms.
Kandiyohi County 3, detected Nov. 12 in a flock of 14-week-old toms.
Kandiyohi County 4, detected Nov. 14 in a flock of 10-week-old toms.

What is controlled marketing?
Controlled marketing is an approved method for recovered, virus-negative birds to continue into the food supply chain, according to the board. Flocks that have been placed under quarantine are routinely tested, and the board tracks their progress as the flock recovers.
When all samples collected from the flock consistently test negative for influenza, the birds are cleared by the board to be marketed. The virus test must occur within seven days of slaughter.
To provide additional assurances that there is no virus spread, designated routes to slaughter that do not pass by other farms are designed and approved, dedicated trucks and load-out equipment are used, and flocks are marketed at the end of the week to provide additional down time for cleanup of processing trucks and equipment, according to the board.
What's next for quarantined flocks?
""We test them every week and we collect two different types of samples,"" Lauer said. ""One is to detect whether the virus is still in the birds and the second test is to determine whether the birds have recovered.""
Lauer said he expects one flock in Kandiyohi County to be cleared this week and another Kandiyohi County flock next week. The remaining quarantined flocks are expected to recover sometime in late December.
After the recovered flocks have been controlled marketed, Lauer said a virus elimination process begins at the impacted farms.
""We want to place birds back in these barns and make sure they are not going to be exposed to any living virus,"" Lauer said.
Impacted barns are heated to 90 degrees for three days to eliminate any of the virus that may remain inside, Lauer said. Then the barns are cleaned, new bedding is brought in and the barns are tested throughout the elimination process to ensure the virus has been removed. Any new birds placed in the barns are tested as well to ensure there is no further virus spread.
""It's a long process to get this all taken care of, but I'm pleased with the way things have gone,"" Lauer said. ""We double-check and we triple-check. We want to make sure that we eliminate it and take the best measures we can to ensure that it's gone.""
This is not the same virus that caused the 2015 avian influenza outbreak that impacted more than 9 million birds in Minnesota, according to the board, but lessons from the 2015 virus are helping contain the spread of this year's strain.
""It's a bad situation to have it in the first place, and it's a bit of a burden and a challenge for the producers who have been affected, but I think it could have been a whole lot worse,"" Lauer said.
He attributed increased biosecurity measures implemented after the 2015 outbreak with helping stop the spread of this year's virus
""After 2015, we really worked with producers on biosecurity and talking about how these viruses move around and get into the barns,"" Lauer said. ""Some of that is beginning to pay off... that's been a big factor with containing it the way we have.""

The virus is related to a North American wild bird low-pathogenic H5N2 lineage.The latest detection occurred on Nov 13 at a facility housing 40,000 birds in the already-affected Kandiyohi County in the central part of the state.  The birds will be depopulated through controlled marketing.Meanwhile, South Africa\'s agriculture ministry reported another highly pathogenic H5N8 outbreak at a commercial ostrich farm, part of a sporadic cluster of outbreaks involving that strain. The latest outbreak began on Oct 29 at a farm in Western Cape province in the south of the country. The virus killed 20 of 461 birds, and the surviving birds were slated for culling.

One of these isolates was also resistant to azithromycin. In addition, the proportion of isolates with decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MICs from 0.032 mg/L to 0.125 mg/L) increased from 15% in 2015 to 17.7% in 2016.Azithromycin resistance remained stable, with a resistance rate of 7.5% in 2016 compared with 7.1% in 2015. But seven isolates (0.3%) from five countries displayed high-level azithromycin resistance, up from five in 2015. Cefixime resistance was detected in 2.1% of isolates in 2016 compared with 1.7% in 2015, and ciprofloxacin resistance remained stable at 46.5% (compared with 49.4% in 2015).The authors of the study-a team of researchers from Public Health England, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and the World Health Organization-say the decreasing ceftriaxone susceptibility and relatively high azithromycin resistance are a major concern, since European guidelines recommend ceftriaxone plus azithromycin as the first-line therapy for gonorrhea. \""With azithromycin resistance at 7.5%, the increasing ceftriaxone MICs might soon threaten the effectiveness of this therapeutic regimen and requires close monitoring,\"" they write.Dec 3 BMC Infect Dis studyHospital study finds little negative impact of prior-season vaccinationAn analysis of the impact of prior flu vaccination on current-season effectiveness in Canadian patients hospitalized for lab-confirmed flu over four consecutive flu seasons mainly found no significant impact. A team from the SOS Network, a flu surveillance system that tracks outcomes in hospitalized Canadian adults, published its findings yesterday in Clinical Infectious Diseases.Some recent studies that looked at the potential effects of prior flu vaccination on current protection have found potentially negative associations between the two, depending on season and strain.For the new investigation, researchers used a matched test-negative design to compare lab-confirmed cases and controls to tested negative over four seasons from 2011-12 to 2014-15. Patients were stratified into four groups based on their flu vaccination history: not vaccinated during the previous and current seasons, the previous season only, the current season only, and both seasons.Researchers observed decreased flu vaccine effectiveness in those immunized both seasons, but it wasn\'t statistically significant and was seen only during two seasons when the H3N2 virus was dominant. In seasons when influenza B viruses or 2009 H1N1 circulated widely, being vaccinated in the previous and current seasons was associated with high vaccine effectiveness against the dominant strain.The researchers concluded that even when they noted a negative impact of consecutive-year flu vaccination, repeated vaccination was still more effective than not receiving the current season\'s vaccine, which they said supports current recommendations for annual flu vaccination.Dec 3 Clin Infect Dis abstractIran, Taiwan report high-path H5 avian flu outbreaksIn highly pathogenic avian influenza developments, Iran reported an outbreak of H5N8 in backyard poultry and Taiwan reported two more H5N2 events on commercial poultry farms, according to separate notifications from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).Iran\'s outbreak, its first involving H5N8 since 2017, occurred in a village in Tehran province in the northern part of the country. The event began on Sep 30, killing 5 of 138 susceptible birds, which included geese, ducks, and free-range chickens. The surviving poultry were culled to curb the spread of the virus.In Taiwan, veterinary authorities reported two more H5N2 outbreaks in Yunlin County, part of ongoing activity involving the strain since 2015. One of the outbreaks began on Nov 15 at a duck farm in Taixi township, while the other began on Nov 21 and affected a goose farm in Yuanchang township. Taken together, the virus killed 146 of 3,730 birds, and the remaining ones were destroyed as part of outbreak response steps.Dec 1 OIE report on H5N8 in Iran Dec 4 OIE report on H5N2 in TaiwanMore Saudi camels test positive for MERS-CoVSaudi Arabia\'s agriculture ministry yesterday reported a MERS-CoV outbreak in camels in the city of Taif in Mecca province, located in the eastern part of the country, according to yet another notification from the OIE.The outbreak began on Sep 25, and 13 of 82 susceptible camels tested positive for MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus).

A poultry farm in Wicomico County had an inconclusive test for avian influenza, leading to 40,000 chickens being put down at a farm in Powellville.
The farm was experiencing ""higher than normal mortality"" and was submitted to the Maryland Department of Agriculture laboratory for a disease screening, according to a release from Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc. Disease screenings include testing for bird flu.
Bird flu is a viral disease that affects multiple species throughout the world, according the Maryland Department of Agriculture. The risk of infecting humans is very low and is often limited only to the people in direct contact with the birds, although occasionally other people have been affected.

The Powellville chickens were diagnosed with and treated for an unnamed ""common bacterial disease,"" according to the DPI release, and mortality returned to normal expected rates.
However, ""out of an abundance of caution,"" DPI said the decision was made to put the birds down. Bob Culver, Wicomico county executive, said 40,000 birds were put down from two houses.
“They did everything they could do to handle it in a positive manner,” Culver said in an interview.

Over the next two weeks, there will be increased testing and surveillance to make sure no other cases of illness appear in other local poultry flocks.
""All poultry flock owners are encouraged to follow strict biosecurity on their farms to prevent the spread of disease,"" DPI said in a release. 
There are no health concerns for human beings, and poultry and eggs are still safe for human consumption.

The price of chicken in the market has come down to Rs 100 per kg from around Rs 150 prior to the reported bird flu outbreak.<br />\""This is just the beginning. If the bird flu threat continues for a week, the price may fall by more than 50 per cent,\"" said Manoj Sahoo, chicken seller of Kendrapara.

Besides bird flu, various other factors like radiation from mobile phone towers,  exposure to cold and other diseases could be responsible for the crow deaths, he said.

PATNA: A statewide alert has been issued in Bihar over a suspected outbreak of bird flu after two separate incidents confirmed the presence of the H1N1 virus in a section of the avian population in the state, officials said on Wednesday.
Four teams of veterinary doctors and officials of the state animal and fisheries resources department conducted inspection of several poultry farms across the state and collected serum samples. The department has ordered preventive measures such as spray of disinfectants to start at all poultry farms. Civil surgeons and animal husbandry department officials in all districts were directed to monitor the situation and send daily reports.
“While no death of poultry birds has been reported in recent months in the state, the samples being collected will be sent to a laboratory in Kolkata for tests,” said an official. The department has also set up two control rooms and issued a helpline number.
Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park in Patna, popularly known as Patna Zoo, was ordered closed for an indefinite period on Tuesday after it was confirmed that bird flu had caused the death of six peacocks in the past ten days. “Strains of the H5N1 virus were found in the samples of the carcasses sent for test at a laboratory in Bhopal,” said principal chief conservator of forests (PCCF) Devendra Kumar Shukla.
The culling of birds had started in Munger district on December 21 after the death of hundreds of crows and poultry birds in a few villages due to the H5N1 infection. The government had then issued an advisory to the district magistrates of all 38 districts to monitor any unusual death of birds.
“All precautionary measures are being taken to ensure the flu does not spread and human beings do not contract the virus. Sanitization drives at the poultry farms are being monitored. Health centres across the state have been put on alert,” said Lokesh Kumar Singh, special secretary of the state health centre. “The situation is entirely in control,” he added.",2018-12-26 07:00:00.000000,done,

The decision was taken after the avian influenza virus H5N1 killed six peacocks in the zoo in the last ten days.
Though the zoo and forest department officials were not sure how the peacocks contacted the virus, but the decision to shut down the zoo (even for morning walkers) was taken to minimise the possibility of catching infection.
Since December 16, six peacocks have died at Patna Zoo. Out of which three were males and three females. The remaining two peacocks have been quarantined.
“The death of peacocks was investigated and sample collections of spleen, lung, trachea, kidney and serum were sent to Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata for tests. The investigations at RDDL suggested symptoms of bird flu after which a test was conducted at National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal. The tests at Bhopal found presence of avian influenza (H5N1) and the cause of death due to H5N1 viral infection,” said the Patna Zoo director Amit Kumar.

Taipei, Dec. 26 (CNA) Taiwan has asked Beijing five times for updates about the outbreak of African swine fever (ASF) in China, but those requests have fallen on deaf ears, a Taiwanese official said Wednesday.Li Tui-chih (李退之), deputy head of the Council of Agriculture (COA), said at a press conference that the council has formally asked China five times to provide updates about ASF, but no response has been received.Li also refuted a remark made by Ma Xiaoguang (馬曉光), spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, earlier in the day that the ASF epidemic in China has not yet reached a ""massive scale.""The disease has spread to 23 Chinese provinces or regions, Li said, asking ""if that is not a massive scale, what is?""He urged Beijing to provide updates on the status of the ASF outbreaks to Taipei.""Stop hurting the feelings of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,"" Li said.Li also rejected Ma's remark that after a personnel change in Taiwan's Rural Development Foundation in 2017, the two sides ceased to exchange information about such outbreaks.Li said Ma's remarks were intended to ""confuse public opinion"" because the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) has always been the contact window for China to report such outbreaks.In contrast to China's failure to report its disease outbreaks, Li said Taiwan has always updated China on the latest development of its avian flu and foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks.At a regular press conference earlier Wednesday, Ma acknowledged that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have an agreement that allows them to report information relating to agricultural products and food safety to each other.However, Ma argued, Taiwan does not import pork from China, so Beijing is not obliged to report ASF outbreaks to Taipei.In response, Kuan An-lu (管安露), a spokesperson for Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, said Ma's remarks misrepresented the cross-strait agreement.Even though Taiwan does not import pork from China, Beijing should still report ASF outbreaks to Taipei because such outbreaks constitute ""safety and health information"" --information that should be reported according to the agreement, Kuan said.

Earlier, he visited the aviary once a day. Now, he visits twice.“Hydrated lime, also called slaked lime, is a good chemical disinfectant. It is being sprinkled on walkways accessible to zoo visitors. The herbal disinfectant, on the other hand, is being used inside enclosures where visitors cannot go. Earlier, disinfectants were used once a week.

Avian influenza is a viral disease that can affect bird species throughout the world. The disease can vary from mild to severe, depending on the virus strain involved. The most severe strain is called highly pathogenic avian influenza, which is characterized by high, fast-moving fatality rates (more than 75%) within infected flocks. Low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild migratory waterfowl and shorebirds without causing illness. LPAI can infect domestic poultry, creating little or no signs of illness, but can reduce bird performance.",2018-12-27 17:13:56.000000,irrelevanti,

The virus was also reported in Asarganj block of Munger district where affected avian species had to be culled. The hospitals have been asked to notify any case of suspected avian influenza in any person by coming into direct contact with dead birds affected with the virus.

Patna civil surgeon Pramod Kumar Jha on Thursday advised people to avoid eggs and poultry chicken till the bird flu threat subsides. “Although the virus cannot survive above 70 degrees Celsius, people should avoid eating eggs and poultry chicken for now as it is possible that the avian species that lay eggs and eaten as a food item might be affected with the virus and people eat them out of ignorance,” he said and added that people should also avoid coming into contact with dead birds.

However, health department principal secretary Sanjay Kumar said there was no need to panic.“As of now, no case of human infection has been reported from any part of the state. But we have issued advisory to all government medical college hospitals to be prepared to deal with any person exposed to avian flu,” he told this newspaper on Thursday.

State animal husbandry department has asked citizens to report any unusual death of avian species on 0612-2230942. “We have also provided Tamiflu capsules to officials engaged in surveying people in the affected areas,” a health department official said.

State epidemiologist Dr Ragini Mishra said the health and animal husbandry departments would monitor people in the affected areas. “The H5N1 virus is contained in Munger district and sanitization of Patna zoo is also under way. But people should avoid direct exposure to dead birds,” Dr Mishra said.

The state health department will soon start programmes to create awareness among people about precautionary measures to be taken in order to prevent avian influenza.

Dr Vikash Keshri, the public health expert in centre for health policy (CHP) at Asian Development Research Institute, said, “In case of bird flu, the transmission from birds to humans is possible. So bird handlers should be extra vigilant while the general public should avoid coming into contact with domestic birds also. People should also avoid contact with birds that appear ill.”

Physician Dr Diwakar Tejaswi also advised people to avoid touching excreta, blood or any fluid of birds. Besides, people should also avoid eating eggs and chicken unless properly cooked on high temperature. Those suffering from breathlessness, muscle pain, cough and fever should get their samples tested in hospitals, he said.",2018-12-27 21:07:00.000000,done,

Hospital authorities, however, said they were well prepared to tackle any such problem. The doctors have been put on alert while the health facilities marked isolation wards to separately keep and treat patients showing any symptom of bird flu.

The state health department issued advisory to all civil surgeons and medical college and hospitals across the state earlier this week to be prepared to deal with suspected cases of bird flu. The presence of H5N1 strain of avian influenza, commonly known as bird flu, was detected from viscera of dead birds in six villages under Asarganj block in Munger district on December 21. Six peafowls died at Patna zoo between December 16 and 23. The lab test reports confirmed the presence of H5N1 virus in the dead birds. However, no case of human infection has been reported from any part of the state so far.

PMCH medical superintendent Dr Rajiv Ranjan Prasad said, “We have arranged a five-bed isolation ward in our respiratory department to treat patients showing flu-like symptoms.”

He said after conducting initial screening of suspected bird flu cases, we will send their samples to Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science (RMRIMS) for laboratory tests. “We also have sufficient stock of Tamiflu medicines that will be given free of cost to any patient affected with H5N1 virus,” he said.

Dr K H Raghwendra, officiating medical superintendent and spokesperson at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), said, “We have a 10-bed isolation ward and a medical intensive care unit (MICU) to deal with any bird flu case.”",2018-12-28 19:30:00.000000,done,

Zoo director Amit Kumar said bird flu was suspected to be the reason behind the fresh casualties. The state health department and district administration have already issued alerts after the death of six peafowls on the zoo premises due to avian influenza (bird flu) last week. The zoo has been temporarily shut down amid bird flu scare. 

“The birds were found dead in their enclosures this morning,” Amit told this newspaper. He said the khalij pheasant enclosure is adjacent to the one for the peafowls. 

“There are eight bird enclosures in the infested area, including the one where six peafowls died between December 16 and 23. The lab test reports from National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, and Regional Disease Diagnostic laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata, had confirmed the six deaths due to avian influenza (H5N1 virus),” Amit said and added that Dr S Nandi and Dr Karikanand from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh visited the zoo on Saturday and inspected the area. 

“They will chalk out plans on Sunday to contain the virus. The samples of the two dead birds have been sent to the NIHSAD for confirmation of suspected bird flu. The carcasses were buried deep underground,” he said.

Under the ongoing serum surveillance, the experts of state animal husbandry department collected fresh samples of more than 400 birds, including domestic and poultry birds, in the 9km radius of Patna zoo as well as from Mubarakpur and Gorhu villages in Munger district where bird flu cases were reported earlier.

Animal husbandry department director Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said the fresh samples of birds’ droppings, feathers or the body parts were collected and sent to Bhopal’s laboratory. “The serum surveillance will continue till.

Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA) A total of 989 turkeys on a farm in Yunlin County were culled after it was confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Sunday.Several turkeys on the farm in Sihu Township were confirmed as having contracted the virus, the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) said in a statement.The BAPHIQ said the Yunlin County Animal and Plant Disease Control Center performed the culling based on standard operating procedures and reminded the farm's operators and other poultry farms in the area to disinfect their facilities.According to BAPHIQ data, 97 poultry farms in Taiwan have been infected with avian flu so far this year.Because the risk of catching avian flu increases during the winter, the BAPHIQ urged farm operators to take preventive measures to stop the spread of the disease, including strict controls of poultry movements and potentially contaminated vehicles and personnel visiting poultry farms.The agency also called on all poultry farm operators to keep their birds warm and in a place with good ventilation as temperatures vary considerably between daytime and nighttime.Farm operators should also keep their poultry from coming into contact with local wild birds and migratory birds, the bureau said.

With the latest deaths, Patna Zoo is now left with only one white peacock that continues to remain isolated in the quarantine cage that is said to be doing well so far.
Interestingly, just a couple of days ago both senior veterinarian D. Jitendra Kumar and Zoo director Amit Kumar had claimed that the zoo had succeeded in containing the spreading of H5N1, or bird flu virus, the latest deaths contradict their claims.

It is now not because there is shortage of budget besides other issues to contend with.
Agriculture Minister Yeshey Penjor said this in response to how the government was going to address the issue of rising stray dog population.
Lyonpo Yeshey Penjor said that stray dog population and rabies control were a serious concern. “Initially, the ministry thought that the programme could be under the ministry’s flagship programme.”
Lyonpo said that if there were too many flagship programmes then the identity or the specialty of the flagship programme would be diluted. “If we propose too many flagship programmes, then it would be as good as the normal programme the ministry is undertaking so we dropped the programme from the flagship programme. But, this is going to come up as a special national programme.”
Lyonpo said that although there is no budget for the programme, the department of livestock has already framed a project proposal for this programme. “It is my responsibility to mobilise the resources for this.”
Lyonpo said that this, however, does not mean that the programme would not be considered less important. “There are so many ways and means to tackle the problems even without resources.”
“We will keep on working in whatever we can do, In the meantime, the ministry in collaboration with GNHC and finance ministry would look for funds and as pledged in DNT’s manifesto, we will definitely make this a special programme,” Lyonpo said.
 
Foot and mouth 
disease
On the recent outbreak of foot and mouth disease in some dzongkhags, Lyonpo urged people not to panic and to consult with the livestock or BAFRA officials in the areas before they transport any dairy products including meat from one place to another.
Lyonpo said that the outbreak of foot and mouth disease was frequently reported not only in Bhutan but in other countries as well.
This year, the outbreak of the disease was reported in 24 gewogs in 13 dzongkhags.
Lyonpo said that the officials with the department of livestock have responded to the outbreak immediately and worked hard in containing the outbreaks of the disease.
In the last two months, foot and mouth disease was reported in 16 gewogs in seven dzongkhags. Lyonpo said that the livestock officials have managed to stop spreading of the disease. “The effort to contain the outbreak is in the process in about six gewogs.”
Lyonpo pointed out that notification by the BAFRA’s director general to its officials in the dzongkhags asking them to be vigilant for any signs of suspected bird flu across the border and their respective jurisdiction was being shared on social media.
Lyonpo said that the outbreak of the bird flu was reported in Odhisa, India. Currently, no outbreak has been reported in the country and the notification was to remind the officials to be cautious and the veterinary vigilance team to be ready if an outbreak is reported in the country.
“If we don’t manage bird flu than despite the distance, the flu can spread to far places in just a day or two,” Lyonpo said.
The spread of the notification on social media could make some people panic, Lyonpo said. “There is nothing to panic about instead people can help to stop spreading these outbreaks.”
“When people hear such news, what is important is for them to cooperate in containing the outbreaks by consulting with livestock officials before transporting the dairy products or products related to bird be it for business or for self-consumption,” Lyonpo said.
In the event of outbreak of the diseases in the country, Lyonpo said that rapid response teams were ready to manage the outbreak.

The places are within 5km from Patna zoo where the H5N1 virus (avian influenza) has claimed the lives of eight birds since December 16.

While three crows and a dove were found dead at the COAC, two crows died near Magadh Mahila College and one adjacent to a nursery on Bailey Road. 

Patna DM Kumar Ravi, however, said the birds might have died due to cold. “There is no need to panic as six teams of the district administration are collecting fresh samples from the places where birds have been found dead,” he said. The DM urged the residents to remain alert. “People should avoid going near bird carcasses and immediately report any death to the helpline number 0612-2230942,” he added.

Doctors have already advised residents to avoid eggs and poultry products.

Veterinary physician at Patna zoo, Dr Samrendra Singh, also urged people to avoid contact with dead birds. “The H5N1 virus not only affects the poultry birds, but also causes death of wild birds like crow and peafowl. Highly pathogenic avian influenza rarely causes the disease in waterfowl, but aquatic migratory birds can transmit it to domestic poultry as well as wild birds,” he said, adding the H5N1 virus can infect human as well and causes cough, fever, sore throat, muscle pain, headache, pneumonia, respiratory disease and sometimes death, especially of those who work in poultry.

Mukesh Kumar, a fourth year student of sculpture department at COAC, said three crows and a dove were found dead on Monday. He said there are a large number of birds on the college premises because of trees. Other COAC students said half a dozen birds died on the college campus within a week. Bhagat, another student, said the officials of animal husbandry department were informed on Monday about the unnatural deaths of birds. “We are aware about the bird flu deaths in the zoo. A dog here died after eating a dead bird four days back,” he said.

Around 200 samples collected from various poultry firms in the city had earlier been sent to Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL) in Kolkata. The Patna zoo has been shut since December 25 after lab tests conformed six peafowls’ death due to avian influenza. Later, one more peafowl and a khalij pheasant were found dead inside the zoo. Experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly (UP) visited the zoo on the last two days and discussed plans to contain avian flu there.

Experts from animal husbandry department and medical advisory committee of zoo collected samples of faecal matter of several birds and sent for test to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) Bhopal on Monday. Even, the samples of water and soil collected from the where the seven peafowls and a khalij pheasant were found dead were also sent to Bhopal. 

“No fresh case of bird’s death has been reported since December 29,” zoo director Amit Kumar told this newspaper on Monday. Amit said the zoo would be reopened only after two consecutive samples test negative. “This is a directive from the Central Zoo Authority,” he added.

Animal husbandry director Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said fresh samples of birds near the zoo would be sent to RDDL. State Health department officials were keeping a close vigil on the developments.",2018-12-31 19:30:00.000000,done,

For each patient admitted with an OXA-23–producing A baumannii strain isolated from clinical specimens during the study period, a respective control patient was selected from adult inpatients matched for age, clinical manifestation, and hospital ward. All medical, nursing, and microbiologic records of hospitalized patients were reviewed.Of the 275 episodes of A baumannii infection or colonization observed during the study period, 41 OXA-23–producing strains were isolated from ICU patients with multiple comorbidities. No differences were observed between the 41 case and 41 control patients regarding baseline demographic data, but a multivariate analysis showed that acquisition of OXA-23–producing A baumannii strains was associated with the use of nasogastric tubes, hemodialysis, and therapy with cephalosporins. Analysis of patient outcomes revealed that patients with OXA-23–producing A baumannii had a mortality rate of 34.1%.All 41 OXA-23–producing A baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant and susceptible to only amikacin, gentamicin, tigecycline, and colistin. Polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the insertion sequence ISAba1—which is associated with increased gene expression leading to high carbapenem resistance—in all the isolates. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that 26 of the isolates belonged to the sequence type (ST) 79 lineage, a high-risk clone in ICUs that's been reported in several multidrug-resistant A baumannii hospital outbreaks in Brazil.The authors of the study report that implementation of infection control measures, including hand hygiene promotion in the ICU, isolation of patients infected or colonized with carbapenem-resistant strains, and environmental cleaning and disinfection of reusable medical equipment helped reduce the incidence of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii after November 2014.Dec 28 PLOS One study Vietnam, Taiwan, India report H5 high-path avian flu outbreaks in poultryVietnam, Taiwan, and India have reported new outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian flu in poultry, according to reports posted by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).Vietnam's outbreak began on Dec 21 in Dak Lak province in the south and sickened 100 village birds and killed 50 in a flock of 215 poultry.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – After a difficult year for poultry farmers in Yunlin County, another farm was discovered to have been infected with the bird flu virus, leading to prompt action by the local government and the culling of almost 100 turkeys in Sihu Township (四湖鄉).
Last week on Dec. 27, a farm worker discovered that a turkey had died of unknown causes, before immediately calling the Yunlin Animal and Plant Disease Control Center. Upon inspection the 11 week old turkey was found to have been infected with the H5N2 Avian Flu Virus.
The entire stock of 989 young turkeys was ordered to be culled. The operation was completed on Saturday, Dec. 29.
The Sihu operation brings the total number of poultry farms in Yunlin County ordered to cull their livestock in 2018 to 62.
The good news is that the number of culling operations in 2018 does represent a decrease when compared to 2017, when 101 poultry farms in Yunlin were forced to cull their livestock over the course of the year.
UDN quotes Cheng An-kuo (鄭安國), a livestock specialist at the county’s Animal and Plant Disease Control Center, as saying that in 2018, the county was forced to kill a total of 445, 514 birds to combat possible spread of the disease. In 2017 that number was 1,174,520.
There are reportedly fears that the virus has become localized, and is being spread between farms by wild birds in the region.

'All precautionary measures have been taken to ensure the flu does not spread and human beings do not contract the virus,' said Modi, who also holds charge of environent, forest and climate change, at a high-level meeting in the state capital to review the bird flu situation.




Modi said the state was put on alert last week after six peacocks were found dead in Patna Zoo due to suspected bird flu. The zoo has been shut.

He said there is no possibility of bird flu spreading in the state as there are no reports of any fresh death of birds since December 30.

Blood and other samples of 26 species of birds from Patna Zoo were sent for tests in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh. A second such sample would be sent on Jan 15. 'The zoo will open only after tests confirm negative results,' he said.

Bihar Health Minister Mangal Pandey said all health centres in Patna are on alert for the flu and all measures have been taken to prevent the flu from spreading to human beings. 'The situation is fully under control,' he said.

In the last week of December, a statewide alert was issued in Bihar over a suspected outbreak of bird flu after two separate incidents confirmed the presence of H1N1 virus in a section of the avian population in the state.

Patna zoo director Amit Kumar told TOI that a detailed meeting was held with the experts from Delhi for containing the avian influenza. “The samples of 26 bird species, including dropping, saliva and feathers, were collected from the zoo and sent to NIHSAD by air on Monday. We have been informed that the samples have been received at the Bhopal laboratory and the corresponding reports will be generated in two days,” Amit said, adding the samples of soil and water from the zoo premises were also sent to NIHSAD.

Patna zoo has been shut since December 25 following the death of six peafowls. NIHSAD and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata, had conformed that the birds had died due to H5N1 virus.

Experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) at Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh — Dr S Nandi and Dr Karikalan — also visited Patna zoo on December 29 and December 30 to assess the situation with regard to bird flu and chalking out action plan to contain the virus.

Meanwhile, senior officials in state environment and forests department said first round of sanitization of zoo premises had been completed and the works were still underway to prevent its spread.

“Though H5N1 virus is not much harmful for human beings, if not contained in due time, it leads to mutation of the virus, which can cause more harmful diseases to human beings. Thus, we are trying to prevent the spread of the virus outside Patna zoo,” principal chief conservator of forest, DK Shukla, told TOI.

Officials in animal husbandry department said works were also underway for a serum surveillance in the 9km radius of Patna zoo to assess the spread of avian influenza virus outside the zoo premises.

He also said the situation with regard to outbreak of avian influenza at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna zoo, was under control.

SuMo, who is also state environment and forests minister, held a high-level review meeting with the department and zoo officials on Wednesday to take stock of the situation at Patna zoo, where seven peafowls and a khalij pheasant died due to bird flu between December 16 and 29.

“We are adhering to the recommendations of the experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Bareilly (UP), who visited the zoo on December 29 and 30 to assess the situation and chalk out action plan for containment of bird flu. Also, the samples of 26 bird species, including blood and feathers along with soil and water from the zoo, were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) at Bhopal on December 31. The second set of samples will be sent on January 15,” SuMo said.

He said a decision with regard to opening the zoo for public will be taken after both the reports from NIHSAD come negative.

The zoo is shut since December 25 following the death of six peafowls from H5N1 virus, which was confirmed by NIHSAD and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata.

Sanitization works were under way at the zoo on Wednesday as well. A statement from the zoo stated that Virkon-S disinfectant was sprayed in the enclosures of hyena, leopards, tiger and lions among other animals.

Animal husbandry department has also collected over 500 samples from poultry farms and shops as part of a serum surveillance conducted in the 9km radius of the zoo to assess the spread of avian influenza virus outside the premises. The samples have been sent to NIHSAD and RDDL, Kolkata.

Meanwhile, health minister Mangal Pandey said his department was alert with regard to spread of bird flu among human beings. “Health department is taking appropriate steps for containment of bird flu. All government hospitals have been alerted to immediately report cases with suspected symptoms of bird flu,” Pandey said.",2019-01-03 07:00:00.000000,done,

Carcasses of over 12 crows were found in an orchard at Walipur village under Narhat panchayat in Nawada on Wednesday, triggering panic in the district. The orchard is owned by one Mahavir Prasad.

Carcasses of eight crows have been found in College of Arts and Crafts at Patna since January 1. The college has been closed till January 5.

Around 10 crows were reportedly found dead in Digha, 10 at Raghunathpur in Siwan and around 12 at Chandanpatti in Sakra block of Muzaffarpur districts on Monday.

Senior animal husbandry department (AHD) officials said experts as well as sanitization workers were sent to all the three places. “After taking samples for H5N1 test at Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata, the dead crows were buried scientifically 10 feet under the ground and bleaching powder was spread in the area,” a senior official in the AHD said.

The official said the massive exercise of culling of birds, including poultry chicken and ducks, in Munger was completed on Sunday. “Total 2,679 birds were culled in four villages, including Mubarakpur in Asarganj block,” the AHD official said. 

Meanwhile, Patna zoo is awaiting reports of the first samples of dead peafowls sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) at Bhopal on December 30. “The report is to come in a day or two, following which we would sent fresh samples for H5N1 virus test. The decision to open the zoo will be taken only after both tests turn negative,” principal chief conservator of forest DK Shukla told TOI. 

The zoo has been shut since December 25 following the death of six peafowls due to H5N1 virus. NIHSAD and RDDL had confirmed that the peafowls died due to avian influenza (H5N1 virus). He said sanitization works for containment of bird flu at the zoo continued on Monday.

AHD has also collected over 600 samples from poultry farms and shops as a part of serum surveillance conducted in the 9km radius of Patna zoo to assess the spread of avian influenza virus outside its premises. Those samples have also been sent to NIHSAD and RDDL.

Jan 7 CDC update As data show high Lyme burden, tick-borne disease law proposedA systematic review of studies on the economic burden of Lyme disease found that the disease poses a significant burden on the United States and other developed countries, researchers from the University of Toronto reported in PLOS One.They focused on 21 studies, which included 10 cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and 11 cost analyses (CA). Most of the CEAs were done before 2003, when a human Lyme disease vaccine was available before it was withdrawn. Seven CAs focused on overall healthcare costs, three targeted diagnostic testing, and one addressed Lyme cardiac treatment.Three CEAs concluded that Lyme disease vaccine was probably cost-effective, but only in endemic areas. Six studies looked at the economic burden from a societal standpoint and found an annual economic impact that ranged from 0.014 US dollars per capita in Scotland ($5.4 million) to 2.41 US dollars per capita in the United States ($326.6 million).The authors concluded that the economic burden is significant enough to justify further research into disease control and management.

The ministry has also implemented the ban on previously infected provinces, including Kurskaya Oblast, Astrakhanskaya Oblast, Respublika Kalmykiya, Kostromskaya Oblast, and Voronezhskaya Oblast in the Russian Federation.
However, according to a statement issued by MoCCAE, thermally-treated poultry products (meat and eggs) have been cleared for import from all parts of Russia.
Dr Majid Sultan Al Qassimi, director, Animal Development at Health Department at MoCCAE, said: ""These measures reiterate the Ministry's keenness in achieving its strategic objectives including enhancing bio-security levels and eliminating pathogens before they enter the country. In doing so, the Ministry prevents the bird flu virus and related risks and impacts on the country’s poultry health and safety, in addition to protecting public health and well-being.""
The ministry said it is carefully scrutinising documentation accompanying consignments of food products shipped into the country while also conducting sensory detection to ensure that the quality of the products complies with the UAE’s stringent standards.

After keeping the zoo shut for nearly a month for general visitors and fitness enthusiasts, authorities at the biological park are considering reopening it next week as Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) has not found strains of virus which causes bird flu in samples collected earlier from the zoo.Samples of 26 breeds of birds and that of soil and water at Patna zoo were sent a couple of weeks ago to NIHSAD for confirmation of the bird flu virus.Altogether, six peacocks had died at the zoo and as NIHSAD had confirmed it was caused by avian influenza (H5N1), commonly known as bird flu. The government decided to close the zoo to ensure segregation of birds and to spray anti-viral disinfectants.“We had to keep it closed to minimise the possibility of catching the infection. We got the park thoroughly sanitised, while the experts from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Bareily too came here and suggested the measures to check the spread of the virus,” said Amit Kumar, director, Sanjay Gandhi biological park.Recently, NIHSAD has confirmed there’s no bird flu virus at the Park and it is been safe for people. On January 15, NIHSAD has collected samples from these birds. “We are waiting for its reports. It’s expected by January 20 and once thenegative report is received, Patna zoo will be reopened,” Kumar said.Official said the park remained closed during the peak season from December 25, 2018 to January 14. “Lakhs of Christmas and New Year revelers and the holidayers turn up to enjoy their vacation. But we had to keep it closed to avoid further infection and inconvenience to the visitors. For us the safety of visitors is the top priority,” Kumar said.Kumar said there is no point of revenue loss as the park is not meant for commercial purposes.

The zoo was shut on December 25 after NIHSAD at Bhopal and Regional Diseases Diagnostic Laboratory (RDDL), Kolkata, confirmed that the six peafowls had died due to H5N1 virus.

This was the second successive report ruling out H5N1 virus in the samples sent from Patna zoo. As per standard operating protocol of the Union ministry of animal husbandry, dairy and fisheries, civilians can be allowed at any place if two consecutive reports are negative for H5N1 virus.

“A third set of samples comprising swab, droppings and feathers of 26 birds as well as soil and water of Patna zoo were sent to NIHSAD on January 15 for H5N1 virus test. The reports of the sample arrived on Tuesday and they are negative,” zoo director Amit Kumar told this newspaper. 

“The second set of samples sent to NIHSAD on December 31 had also tested negative. According to standard procedure, the next step will be to obtain a clearance certificate from state animal husbandry department before opening the zoo to general public. For this, a committee will be formed comprising members of state government, Patna zoo and animal husbandry department. We are working on this,” he said.

According to the inspection report presented by experts from Indian Veterinary Research Institute at Izatnagar in UP, the zoo can be reopened for visitors after 21 days from the last death of any bird in the park.

“Various measures have been taken to boost sanitation and prevent further contamination. Anti-infection medicine has been sprayed in the vicinity of hyena and leopard cage, hospital campus and grain storage. Blowgun firing is done near bird cage numbers 25, 26 and 27. The soil patch has been changed at a couple of places and lime powder is sprinkled on the ground,” Amit said.

Meanwhile, fitness enthusiasts and wildlife lovers are eagerly waiting for the zoo to reopen. “My husband and I are a regular at the zoo for morning walks. We have been going to Rajdhani Vatika since the zoo was closed. We are eagerly waiting for the zoo to reopen as it is more spacious and better suited for long walks,” said Putul, a resident of Anisabad.",2019-01-23 00:55:00.000000,done,

The recent inspection, conducted on 27 January, found similar symptoms in one of the swift tern birds on the same island, he added. But, Siluka said, central veterinary laboratory results expected soon were still needed to determine the exact cause of the seabirds' mortalities. The deaths of the penguins were discovered late last month, and about 250 mostly adult birds have been reported dead. He said the ministry is committed to visiting the island on a regular basis, despite rough weather conditions, to collect dead penguins' bodies, and burn them to avoid the further spread of the suspected cause of death. “We are also collecting and rehabilitating the infected penguins at our intensive care facilities,” he continued. Siluka said the biggest worry is that penguins are already endangered species. “Besides good population growth recorded on this island, here comes another catastrophe to the penguins' population growth,” he stated. Halifax Island, according to the ministry's spokesperson, is the third most important breeding site for African penguins, and is home to about 2 500 penguins that contribute to the entire Namibian population of about 26 000 penguins. Other seabirds breeding on the island include crowned cormorants, swift terns and Hartlaub's gulls. Penguins are part of a food web, and basically feeding regimes of other seabirds as well, and the ministry was thus working around the clock to establish the cause of death.",2019-01-31 12:24:42.000000,done,

Livestock Principal Secretary Harry Kimutai says Uganda has submitted the report on eradication of the disease to World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).
""Uganda has submitted the report to OIE and we are waiting for the same, we are going to lift the ban on poultry exports from Uganda as soon as we get it,"" he said.
The ban imposed in January 2017 would have been lifted last November but Kenya said it did not get the status report on the disease in Uganda.

Currently, only three Ugandan firms are allowed to export their poultry products to Kenya following a partial lift in August 2017. They are Hudani Manji Holdings, SR Afrochick and Kukuchic.

At the time, Kenya spelt out tough conditions including that chickens be held in secured premises free from the disease for at least six weeks; there should have been no other outbreak in the surrounding 10 kilometres radius for 30 days; hatching eggs originate from breeding flocks free of the disease and must have been present in a hatchery for at least six weeks before export.
The outbreak of the virulent H5 strain of avian flu in Uganda in January 2017 significantly crippled the poultry industry, which is driven by exports into the region.
Avian flu is a highly infectious disease that affects many animals, including humans, rats, mice and dogs.
The outbreak was first detected in wild ducks on the Ugandan side of Lake Victoria at Lutembe beach near Entebbe in Masaka and Wakiso districts.",2019-01-31 15:50:55.000000,irrelevant,eradication of bird flu in Uganda

They used a test-negative design. Last year's season was severe, and the H3N2 strain was predominant.VE against all strains was 38% (95% confidence internal [CI], 31% to 43%). For H3N2 VE was 22% (95% CI, 12% to 31%), for 2009 H1N1 it was 62% (95% CI, 50% to 71%), and against influenza B it was 50% (95% CI, 41% to 57%).In addition, the researchers estimated that vaccination prevented 7.1 million illnesses, 3.7 million medical visits, 109,000 hospitalizations, and 8,000 deaths. Vaccination prevented 10% of expected hospitalizations overall and 41% among children 4 years old and younger.In an accompanying commentary, Kathleen M. Neuzil, MD, MPH, and Meagan C. Fitzpatrick, PhD, of the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said, ""The results are qualitatively similar to a previous model that looked at a range of effectiveness estimates and applied them to US burden. In fact, the model published here is considerably more conservative, and represents the lowest possible bound for estimates of disease averted.""They add that the data reinforce the importance of routine seasonal flu vaccination.Feb 2 Clin Infect Dis studyFeb 2 Clin Infect Dis commentary Deadly Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria grows to 213 casesThe World Health Organization (WHO) said late last week it is scaling up its response efforts in Nigeria after a Lassa fever outbreak affecting people in 16 states has grown to 213 confirmed cases, including 41 deaths.All of the cases and deaths have been recorded since Jan 1.

The team reported their findings yesterday in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. They noted that experiments in the 1950s and 1960s showed that several bat species were naturally and experimentally susceptible to Zika virus, with some developing neurological disease.In the new experiments, Jamaican fruit bats infected in the lab mounted an antibody response. In some of the bats during 28-day follow up, researchers found evidence of viral replication and pathologic findings in the brain, testes, lungs, and salivary glands. They didn't find any blood brain barrier disruption and raised the possibility that microglial cells might be the Zika virus entry route to bat brains.They concluded that bats might be a suitable animal model for studying Zika pathogenesis, including the assessment of sexual transmission, in-utero transmission, birth defects, and neurologic derangements. They also note that Zika could be a wildlife disease that affects bat populations, and more study is needed to fully understand the role bats might play in maintaining the virus.Feb 4 PLOS Negl Trop Dis abstract",2019-02-05 22:03:45.000000,Irrelevant/ human case,MERS-Cov

The UAE has banned the import of all birds and poultry from Kuwait after the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu (H5N8) in the GCC state.
The UAE’s ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) confirmed on Thursday that the decision was based on a notification from the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases. 
All species of domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, and their non-heat-treated by-products and waste from Kuwait have been banned until the outbreak is brought under control, the ministry said. 
However, thermally-treated poultry products (meat and eggs) have been cleared for import from Kuwait.
Sheikh Dr Majid Sultan Al Qassimi, director of Animal Health and Development Department at MOCCAE, said: “Through taking immediate precautionary measures to curb any strains of the bird flu virus that has affected Kuwait from reaching the UAE, MOCCAE hopes to ensure bio-security levels and prevent the spread of pathogens in the country. 
“We are confident such efforts will mitigate the impact of the bird flu on the UAE’s poultry health and safety, in addition to protecting public health and well-being.” 
The ministry is carefully scrutinising documentation accompanying consignments (certificate of origin, health certificate and halal certifications, among others) of food products shipped into the country, it said. 
It is also conducting sensory detection to ensure that the quality of the products – as per their identification cards – complies with the UAE’s stringent standards. 
Samples of food products from shipments are transferred to laboratories for the necessary tests to ensure they are safe and fit to enter the country.
According to the latest report from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), a total of 68 countries worldwide have been affected by avian influenza in domestic birds between January 2013 and August 2018. In total, 7,122 outbreaks have been reported in domestic birds during the period.
Earlier this year, the UAE also banned the import of poultry, meat and live birds from parts of Russia, following the outbreak of the H5N2 strain of bird flu in the country.

The department had on January 28 sent samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSD), Bhopal, which said the tests confirmed the same, Dr Vijay Singh, director of the animal husbandry department, said. 

Singh said: “In Gomia, bird flu has affected crows, while in Godda, the tests were positive for crows as well as poultry chicken. We have asked the administration to keep a vigil on the situation.”

The mysterious death of crows has become a major cause of concern for residents of Gomia, where rotting carcasses of these birds have become a common sight. 

District animal husbandry officer Arun Kumar Sinha said: “We have now collected swabs of poultry and sent them for tests to confirm if bird flu has affected chicken. It is safe to consume eggs and chicken because they are cooked at very high temperatures. There is no need for panic.” He said response teams led by veterinary doctors have been constituted in each block.

State health, family welfare and medical education department has issued directives to all the district hospitals to screen people if they show any symptoms of swine flu. The surveillance officers at all the districts have been directed to collect samples for test. Viral Transport Media (VTM) kits have been available at all state-run medical colleges, including RIMS, MGMCH Jamshedpur and PMCH Dhanbad to ensure that patients can be tested within 24-48 hours of suspected infection. An advertisement has been issued for publication in all dailies so that people can be made aware about the disease.

Speaking to TOI, state surveillance officer of integrated disease surveillance program (IDSP) Rakesh Dayal said : “We have alerted all the district hospitals to maintain buffer stock of medicine and VTM kits have been supplied to them.

Besides, we have sent poultry samples to the Bhopal lab as a precautionary measure,” he said, adding that reports were expected in a couple of days.The animal husbandry officer nonetheless advised poultry farmers to isolate and cull sick birds, restrict access to healthy ones, clean cages and equipment regularly, disinfect footwear/gloves of workers and stop borrowing supplies from other farms.“People who eat chicken and eggs need not worry. Boiling these above 70°C kills the H5N1 virus. Also, to avoid human infection in case of an outbreak, one must avoid domesticating poultry birds,” Sinha said.The nine quick response teams, the officer said, would aid in containing the spread of bird flu. “If need be, more than one team can be rushed to a particular block or area to assist in culling. Each team is lead by a veterinarian who will supervise culling, disposal of carcasses, vaccination and disinfecting poultry farms,” he said.On how the crows contracted the deadly H5N1 virus, Sinha said it was possible that some migratory avian species were the carriers. “This winter, several migratory birds were seen in and around Bokaro, including Gomia.

JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA (ADV) – The Namibian government has announced that it was alert amid an outbreak of avian influenza, also known as avian flu.
Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry acting chief veterinary officer, Albertina Shilongo, told The Namibian that the disease has been detected in penguins at Halifax Island near Lüderitz in the Kharas region recently.
“When you vaccinate these chickens, you will not get rid of the virus. But if you do not vaccinate them, you will be able to contain the outbreak,” said Shilongo.
She noted that this was the first time that the country experiences this outbreak. Currently, over 200 penguins of the 7000 population have died from the disease.
The disease was discovered after a team from the marine life awareness group arrived the Halifax Island, and counted 184 dead penguins last month.
Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species. Avian flu viruses do not normally infect humans.
Avian Flu symptoms include sudden death without any signs; lack of coordination; purple discolouration of the wattles, combs, and legs; soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; lack of energy and appetite; diarrhoea; swelling of the head, eyelids, comb, wattles and hocks; and nasal discharge.

THE fisheries ministry yesterday announced an outbreak of a highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) at Halifax island, close to Luderitz.
According to the Acting Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Albertina Shilongo, the outbreak is a first for Namibia and was detected in penguins last week. Over 200 were killed from a population of 7000 penguins.
“No other birds on the island are affected at the moment. The dead penguins were burnt and buried at the island. H5N8 is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A of the influenza virus which occurs worldwide. All birds are susceptible to the disease although some species are more resistant. The disease is characterised by severe illness, rapid death with a mortality rate that can approach 100%,” Dr. Shilongo warned.
She added that common symptoms include swelling and purple discoloration of the head, comb and wattle, swelling and red discoloration of the feet, bleeding of internal organs and muscles, diarrhea, twisting of the neck, staggering movement and paralysis of wings and legs.
Dr. Shilongo further cautioned that wild birds play a role in the spread of the disease. Domestic birds like chickens can be infected if close contact is made. She said that although the Avian influenza sub type is not known to infect humans, other strains like H5N1, H7N9 may be transmitted to humans.
Humans can be infected via the eyes, nose and mouth while handling and coming into close contact with infected poultry. She added that handling and consuming infected products is dangerous for humans.",2019-02-14 14:28:00.000000,done,

Director, Animal Husbandry, Chitaranjan Kumar said, “We had sent samples from each district for confirmation of bird flu (H5N1) of which the one from Fajilkhutahari village of Godda came in positive.
A team from the centre has arrived at the district to conduct surveillance and take necessary steps. Action is being taken by the district administration as prescribed under the Government of India’s action plan, 2015.”
The samples were sent to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal which confirmed AI in Fajilkhutahari village of Godda. Following this a directive was issued to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand by the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare to carry out control and containment operations as per the action plan of animal husbandry for preparedness, control and containment of avian influenza, 2015. The various steps to be taken includes declaration of infected and surveillance areas, restricting access to the infected premises, destruction of birds, disposal of dead birds and infected materials, clean-up and disinfection followed by sealing of the premises and issue of sanitization certificate and others.
Based on the guidelines of the action plan, district administration has notified the names of all such villages within one kilometre radius of the site confirmed of AI as infected zone while the area from one kilometre to 10 kilometre radius has been notified as surveillance zone.
Sub divisional officer (SDO) of Mahagama, Banka Ram, informed that seven villages have been identified as infected zones including Falilkhutahari, Meghachasar, Shobhapur, Tarkurwa, Bhalu, Barari and Sukhari.
“Meghachasar is the biggest commercial area with a huge number of non-vegetarian items being sold here so the culling of birds started here,” he said. Ram informed that the shopkeepers were paid Rs 70 per unit for chicken, Rs 130 per unit for duck and Rs 3 per egg before the birds were destroyed.
Meanwhile, the health department released an awareness advertisement regarding both AI and Swine Flu on Thursday, which will be out in newspapers on Friday.
""The awareness message informs citizens about the symptoms of both bird flu and swine flu and dos and don'ts,"" said Dr. Rakesh Dayal, State Surveillance Officer, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP).
Dayal informed that people need not worry about the disease as not a single case of AI has been detected in human. ""The cases have only been detected in birds and transmission from birds to human is extremely rare,"" he said.
He further informed that health screening of villagers in the affected village has already been done and no suspected case has been found. ""People have been directed not to handle dead birds if they come across one to avoid getting infected,"" Dayal said.
In another instance, AI was also found in a crow sample sent from Gomiya block of Bokaro. Bokaro Deputy Commissioner, Shailesh Chaurasia said, “While AI was confirmed in crows, we sent a chicken sample as well and the reports for that came out negative so there is nothing to worry about. Had the chicken sample been positive, we would have issued an alert.”",2019-02-14 17:35:03.000000,done,

In 2013, MenB became available for outbreak response, and, by 2015, MenB vaccines were available for wider use, though not routinely administered.From January 2013 to May 2018, there were 10 university-based meningococcal disease outbreaks caused by serogroup B reported in seven states, which resulted in 39 cases and 2 deaths (5% case-fatality rate).""Only 1 case occurred in a student who previously received MenB vaccine; this student had been vaccinated with 1 dose of MenB vaccine 6 days before disease onset,"" the study authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. ""The remaining cases occurred in persons believed to be unvaccinated with MenB vaccine.""In all but two outbreaks, mass vaccination campaigns with MenB were put in place across campus, and the vaccine was also offered at campus health centers, by appointment, and during seasonal flu vaccinations. Still, MenB vaccination coverage in response to university-based outbreaks was highly variable, ranging from an estimated 14% to 98% for the first dose (median, 67%), the study authors said.""Coverage with >1 dose of MenB vaccine among persons 17 years of age was estimated to be 14.5% in 2017 (13), and a recent survey demonstrated that only 2% of universities require MenB vaccination for student,"" the authors concluded. ""Achieving high MenB vaccination coverage is necessary to help protect persons during outbreaks of meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B.""

WALVIS BAY - The Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources says samples collected from hundreds of dead penguins tested by the Central Veterinary Laboratory tested positive for Avian Influenza H5N8, a type of bird flu.
This follows after about 250 dead penguins were discovered late December on Halifax Island situated about 10 kilometres from Luderitz.
According to a press statement issued by the public relations officer of the ministry, De Wet Siluka, this specific strain of bird flu normally occurs naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other birds or animal species as well. However, it does not normally infect humans.
Siluka said the ministry of fisheries has already taken precautionary measures and will continue to contain the infection to prevent further spreading.  
“Such measures include regular visits to collect dead carcasses, isolating the sick birds and disinfecting wet areas around the colonies, and chemicals as the virus cannot survive in salt water,” he assured members of the public.
The infected birds will not usually get sick but can spread the contagious virus that can even kill certain domestic bird species including chickens and turkeys.
“Infected birds shed the virus through their saliva, nasal secretion and faeces.  Healthy birds can contract the virus by coming in contact with contaminated services.  However the good thing is that the virus cannot survive in salt water,” he said.
Halifax is situated about 10 kilometres west of Luderitz and is located about 100 metres off the mainland.  It is the third most important breeding site for African penguins and home to about 2 500 that contribute to the entire Namibian population of 26 000 penguins.  Other seabirds such as the crowned cormorants, swift terns and Hartlaub’s gulls also breed on this island.  Senior fisheries biologist, Desmond Tom, told New Era yesterday that humans are not at risk, however they can spread the virus to other animals if they get into contact with infected animals.  
“The good thing however is that the island is currently non-accessible to people apart from fisheries officials,” he said.

Taipei, Feb. 18 (CNA) More than 32,500 free-range chickens on a farm in Changhua County have been culled after the farm was confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus, an official from the county's Animal Disease Control Center (ADCC) said Monday.ADCC Director Tung Meng-chih (董孟治) said the birds were exterminated and disinfectant work carried out at the farm after the test results came back a day earlier.Suspicion of an avian influenza outbreak arose after 340 chickens on the farm died within a relatively short space of time.In wake of the latest cull, Tung reminded farmers that if they discover their poultry showing symptoms such as swollen faces, bleeding from the eyes and nostrils, and other signs of disease to proactively contact their local animal disease control centers.According to statistics provided by the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ), four other poultry farms across the country have been affected by the H5N2 avian influenza virus so far this year, including two chicken farms and one duck farm in Yunlin County, and one duck farm in Pingtung County.BAPHIQ statistics also show that a total of 93 poultry farms were hit by H5N2 in 2018.H5N2, a subtype of the influenza A virus, is known to infect a wide variety of birds, including chickens, ducks, turkeys and ostriches.

TAIPEI (Taiwan News) -- An outbreak of the avian influenza virus (bird flu) has been reported in a farm in western Taiwan's Changhua County, with more than 340 chickens found dead from the disease and over 32,500 culled, announced the Animal Disease Control Center (ADCC) yesterday (Feb. 18).
ADCC Director Tung Meng-chih (董孟治) told the media yesterday that a farm located in Changhua County's Dacheng Township notified the Changhua County Animal Disease Control Center on Feb. 13 that there were 340 sudden, successive deaths by its chickens, and they suspected that avian influenza could be the culprit. When inspectors arrived on the scene, they cordoned off the area and took samples of the farm's free-range chickens.
Tung said that test results came on Sunday (Feb. 17) which confirmed that the farm's chickens had contracted the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Staff from the Changhua County Animal Disease Control Center rushed in to cull 32,500 free-range chickens on the firm and disinfected the area to prevent the spread of the virus.
Tung stressed that the H5N2 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza has long been localized in Taiwan and coupled with the arrival of migratory birds during the winter, the opportunities for spreading the virus have been increased. 
Tung said that if a poultry farm notices that their livestock are displaying suspicious symptoms, such as facial swelling, bleeding from the eyes and beak, lack of appetite, diarrhea, breathing problems, and sudden deaths, the livestock owner should notify the township and municipal public office or Animal Disease Control Center.",2019-02-19 02:58:00.000000,done,

Mr Shaset said the two farms were decontaminated, disinfected and quarantined to avoid further spread to nearby farms and have other poultry farmers incur loses.
The official said the government had taken positive and stringent steps to avert the further spread of the disease to other areas of the state, which if left unattended to, could also transmit into human beings, which according to him, could be very disastrous.
Mr Shaset charged poultry farmers and live bird marketers to step up bio-security and hygiene measures within and around their farms and markets.
He advised Plateau residents to avoid the sale, slaughtering and consumption of sick and dead birds to avoid being infected. (NAN)",2019-02-20 04:17:16.000000,done,

Qattan also explained that eight cases had been thoroughly examined over suspicions of being infected with bird flu but all diagnosis results came negative. 
General assembly meeting Kuwait Teachers Society (KTS) Chairman Mutee Al-Ajmi announced that the administrative court issued an expedited ruling on the validity and legality of the measures followed by KTS to call for a general assembly meeting, according to correspondence with the Ministry of Social Affairs. Speaking at a press conference held yesterday, Ajmi said the ruling emphasizes the legality of the measures KTS followed to hold a general assembly meeting on February 19. “However, the ministry’s representatives acted strangely and left the meeting for no reason,” he remarked, explaining that due to a lack of quorum at the time set to start the meeting (4 pm), a legal measure was taken to postpone the meeting for half an hour and then hold it with whoever was present, which had been used for years. “This raises a huge exclamation about such an unjustified action by the ministry”, he said. Meanwhile, Ministry of Social Affairs’ acting undersecretary Hana Al-Hajeri said the ministry requested postponing the KTS general assembly meeting to finalize the measures stipulated in article 25 of its law and to protect members’ rights. Hajeri added that the ministry’s representatives were present, but found only a few of KTS’ 10,578 members had shown up to attend the meeting, and thus the meeting was postponed for two weeks in accordance to the law for lack of quorum. 
Outstanding women A total of 112 women from 20 countries are nominated to take part in the Kuwait International Award for Outstanding Women, including 70 Kuwaitis and 42 others from the US, Europe, Asia and Africa, Security General of the General Secretariat of the Supreme Council for Planning and Development Khaled Mahdi announced yesterday. Mahdi explained that Kuwaiti nominees include 41 working in the government sector, 28 working in the private sector and 43 from various NGOs, noting that the nominees will be interviewed and the winners will be honored in a special ceremony on March 6, 2019.

The agency had not confirmed the death, in a person from New York, until yesterday.""Epidemiologic and laboratory evidence indicated that many types of raw chicken products from a variety of sources are contaminated with Salmonella Infantis and are making people sick,"" the agency said in its final statement on the outbreak. However, it said illnesses could continue, because the Salmonella strain appears to be widespread in the chicken industry.In interviews, people reported eating different types and brands of chicken products. Officials confirmed the outbreak strain in samples taken from raw chicken products, raw chicken pet food, and live chickens, but they could not identify a single, common supplier. Therefore, no food recall was initiated because of the outbreak.Illness-onset dates range from Jan 8, 2018, to Jan 27, 2019. Patients range in age from less than 1 year to 105, with a median age of 42, and 69% are female.Of 69 people interviewed, 60 (87%) reported preparing or eating chicken products that were bought raw, including ground chicken, chicken pieces, and whole chicken. One person got sick after pets in the home ate raw ground chicken pet food, and two patients live with someone who works in a facility that raises or processes chickens.The CDC said it and the US Department of Agriculture are working with the poultry industry to explore ways to reduce Salmonella Infantis in chicken products.Feb 21 CDC update Oct 17, 2018, CIDRAP News scan Afghanistan, Pakistan report wild poliovirus casesBoth Afghanistan and Pakistan recorded recent wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, according to the latest update today from the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI).In Afghanistan, a patient from Kandahar province experienced symptom onset on Jan 12. This is the second WPV1 case recorded in 2019 in Afghanistan. The country recorded 21 cases in 2018.In neighboring Pakistan, two cases were recorded, both with onset of paralysis on Jan 20. The cases originated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces. These cases raise Pakistan's 2019 total number of WPV1 cases to 4, compared with 12 last year.The GPEI also noted the Feb 20 meeting of the World Health Organization's International Health Regulations and Emergency Committee, which unanimously agreed that the risk of polio spread continues to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Feb 22 GPEI update  Officials detail how contaminated water supply caused campylobacteriosisMunicipal water supply contaminated with livestock waste runoff was the cause of a campylobacteriosis outbreak in Nebraska in 2017, according to a study today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR).The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services was notified of 39 cases of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni in March 2017, and the only shared exposure associated with illness (odds ratio, 7.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 36.36) was to city tap water.""A collaborative on-site investigation revealed that during the pumping of a large volume of livestock wastewater from a concentrated animal feeding operation through a center pivot irrigation system, the system malfunctioned at an undetermined time,"" the study authors said. The malfunction allowed wastewater to collect near two wells that served the city.Campylobacter infection is one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States, affecting an estimated 1.3 million people each year. It is often associated with eating raw or undercooked poultry.""This investigation demonstrates the importance of considering exposure to untreated water sources as a potential cause for Campylobacter outbreaks. Including this risk factor in initial questioning could help to expedite outbreak investigations,"" the authors concluded.

According to the press release, the genetic codes provided by the synthetic dMAb trigger the body to make the therapeutic antibodies, meaning production of the monoclonal antibodies doesn't rely on manufacturing in bioreactors, a fact that can speed development and cut costs.J. Joseph Kim, PhD, Inovio's president and chief executive officer, said the first human study of INO-A002 could provide important information about the platform, which could lead to production of other dMAbs targeting other infectious diseases, cancers, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease.Feb 20 Inovio press release H5 avian flu outbreaks strike birds in China and IndiaIn the latest highly pathogenic avian flu outbreak developments, China reported an H5N6 event in poultry and India reported more H5N1 detections in house crows.China's H5N6 outbreak occurred at a poultry farm in Yunnan province, which killed 463 birds and led to the culling of 55,917, Reuters reported today, citing a report from China's agriculture ministry.

The H5N1 (avian influenza) virus causes what is commonly known as bird flu.“Our sole intention is to contain the disease for the safety of people and poultry. As the bird flu cases were detected in Ranchi city, I advised poultry bird dealers not to take back unsold birds (chicken) to their farms as it may cause them heavy loss,” Kumar said.He also denied unconfirmed reports that the directorate had banned the entry of vehicles carrying poultry to the city. “No ban on the movement of vans carrying poultry birds has been imposed,” he said. “The order to not take back unsold birds to farms is our precautionary measure.” Most poultry dealers at the main markets of the capital, Morabadi, Karamtoli, Kantatoli, Ratu Road, Kutchery, Boreya, Hinoo and Doranda, seemed aware of the directive. Md Qurban, a Kantatoli chicken dealer, said he bought limited stocks to the city. “We bring limited chicken from Boreya to the city market (Kantatoli) and try to sell all the stock. If demand is low, we even sell chicken at a lower price,” he said. “But so far, we find the demand for chicken is more or less the same. Chicken continues to sell for Rs 120 a kilo, the same as before” he added. Some customers however said they had stopped consuming chicken after coming to know of the bird flu deaths. Bankim Chandra Seth, a computer operator in an MGNREGS scheme in Bundu, said he stopped eating chicken when he read that bird flu had been detected in Godda about 20 days ago. “That was before this Ranchi case.

At present, RIMS sends blood samples for Swine Flu test to Kolkata, which makes the process time consuming. Quicker test results are likely to help the hospital start necessary treatment sooner, say doctors.
“We are planning to set up a lab for RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) test at RIMS. The work is in progress,” said Dr. Manoj Kumar, Head of the Department of Microbiology at RIMS.
The RT-PCR is a laboratory technique combining reverse transcription of Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) to Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). It is used to measure the count of a specific RNA in blood samples.
There are set guidelines to conduct molecular tests for H1N1 flu in a bid to ensure that the test results are accurate and the lab activities do not cause any hazard to the environment.
“We need at least a Bio Safety Level 2 lab for conducting H1N1 tests. There are strict norms that we need to follow,” Kumar said.
This year RIMS has sent at least 26 samples for H1N1 test to Kolkata and has received only 21 reports. Reports for the remaining five samples are still awaited. The entire process takes at least four days to a week, doctors said.
Jharkhand has been hit by a Swine Flu outbreak this year, with at least 26 cases of H1N1 flu reported from across the state. Twenty of the 26 cases are from Simedga, three from Ranchi and remaining three from Jamshedpur.  The influenza virus has claimed one life in Ranchi so far this year. The situation appears to be alarming since only four cases of H1N1 Flu were reported in Jharkhand last year.
Besides Swine Flu, the State also fears a possible occurrence of Bird Flu in Jharkhand after sudden deaths of several crows reported in parts of Bokaro.
After death of a crow due to suspected H5N1 Avian Influenza in Ranchi’s Morhabadi area, serum samples of around 100 domestic birds from the locality have been sent for tests to Bhopal, said Civil Surgeon Dr. VB Prasad.
Officials from the Animal Husbandry Department said that lab tests of the crow confirmed that it died of Avian flu. However, this is not enough reason to panic since infected “wild birds” do not usually cause an outbreak, they added.",2019-02-23 17:33:23.000000,done,

As of today, 345 penguin carcasses, excluding chicks, were recovered from the island and nearby beaches... the real toll is by now probably in excess of 500 birds, mostly breeding adults,” a recent post on the group's Facebook page reads. According to the group, they have noticed that most of the affected penguins are clustered around “colony 2” on the south side of the island, and in particular near a muddy patch adjoining this colony. “As the virus H5N8 can survive for weeks in a wet environment, we suspect that this mud patch might be a factor in the continuing mortalities as it is crossed daily by adult penguins returning from the sea,” the Facebook post further reads. The group said the fisheries ministry's officials had recently spread buckets of salt over the mud patch in an attempt to lower the rate of infection. Dr Jean-Paul Roux, a member of the research group, who spoke to The Namibian yesterday, said the damage in terms of the dying penguins might be more serious because it is not known whether the outbreak had spread to the three adjacent Possession, Ichaboe and Mercury islands.

As of today, 345 penguin carcasses, excluding chicks, were recovered from the island and nearby beaches... the real toll is by now probably in excess of 500 birds, mostly breeding adults,"" a recent post on the group's Facebook page reads.
According to the group, they have noticed that most of the affected penguins are clustered around ""colony 2"" on the south side of the island, and in particular near a muddy patch adjoining this colony.
""As the virus H5N8 can survive for weeks in a wet environment, we suspect that this mud patch might be a factor in the continuing mortalities as it is crossed daily by adult penguins returning from the sea,"" the Facebook post further reads.
The group said the fisheries ministry's officials had recently spread buckets of salt over the mud patch in an attempt to lower the rate of infection.

Dr Jean-Paul Roux, a member of the research group, who spoke to The Namibian yesterday, said the damage in terms of the dying penguins might be more serious because it is not known whether the outbreak had spread to the three adjacent Possession, Ichaboe and Mercury islands.
Attempts to get comment from the fisheries ministry's De Wet Siluka on the situation proved futile as he did not respond to questions e-mailed to him on Tuesday.
The agriculture ministry last week issued a warning to farmers on the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
Avian influenza, also known as avian flu, is an infectious bird disease caused by type A strains, which occur worldwide, although some bird species are more resistant than others.
Acting chief veterinary officer Albertina Shilongo said this was the first avian flu outbreak in Namibia.

IEDCR committees have conducted investigations at hospitals and other locations, collecting samples from health workers, as well as other family members, neighbors, and villagers. None of other family member tested positive.The IEDCR said it's not known if the patient whose sample was positive had a history of drinking raw date palm sap, a known risk factor for the disease because of virus contamination through bat droppings. The agency said the four others may have been infected by the individual whose samples were positive.Nipah virus is harbored by bats, which can transmit the disease to people and other animals. It is one of three priority areas targeted by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI). In 2018, a Nipah virus outbreak in India's Kerala state was linked to 17 deaths.

The Department of Animal Husbandry on Friday cleared the suspense saying that chicken was safe for consumption here.
The department had sent at least 36 blood samples of domestic birds from across Jharkhand for H5N1 tests to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal where none of the samples tested positive.
“It is safe to consume chicken in Jharkhand. However, one should prefer curry preparations over tandoor items as a precautionary measure for the time being,” said Chitranjan Kumar, Director with Animal Husbandry Department.
Kumar said that the samples sent for test were collected from chicken shops and poultries in different localities of Ranchi and other important cities after a few crows died of suspected avian influenza.
“Only one crow had died of avian influenza in Morhabadi locality. We collected samples of domestic birds from shops within the periphery of Morhabadi and none of them tested H5N1 positive,” he said.
The Bird Flu scare had a marginal effect on the sale of chicken in Ranchi. However, the prices fell from Rs.140 per kilogram to Rs.130 per kilogram in some parts of the city in the past couple of weeks. The rumours had also affected the sale of chicken items at restaurants and eateries. A few smalltime eateries at educational institutions in and around Ranchi had stopped selling chicken items after Bird Flu rumours started doing the rounds.
Manoj Kumar, a veterinarian at the Animal Husbandry Department said that Bird Flu was unlikely to make a return to Jharkhand once winter retreats. If at all a bird is infected, the virus will not survive once the chicken is cooked at a temperature above 100 degrees Celsius, he added.
By now, only crows have died in Jharkhand of avian influenza and the death of crows is not considered a valid reason for sounding an alert, officials said. “Yes, crows have died of the virus in Jharkhand but we do not sound alerts when a wild bird dies. At least one domestic bird has to test H5N1 positive for us to sound an alert in the state,” said Kumar.
Meanwhile, rumours were rife that some domestic birds died of avian flu in Godda district. However, the department is yet to find any concrete evidence indicating deaths due to H5N1 influenza in the district.",2019-03-08 17:31:31.000000,irrelevant,

LÜDERITZ- Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources scientists found 27 penguins dead and three sick birds showing symptoms of Bird flu, even with the efforts from the ministry to control the spread of the virus.
The scientists continue to take necessary measures to contain the infection as well as prevent further spreading by collecting and burning dead carcasses, isolating sick birds showing symptoms as well as disinfecting wet areas around the colonies where most dead birds have been found. The wet areas were disinfected by spreading salts on the mud pools at the colonies and covering it up with beach sand.   The fisheries biologist under the Seabirds and Offshore Islands Section, Desmond Tom, indicated that a virologist from University of Namibia is willing to do DNA sequencing for viral genomics, discovery and evolution with the assistance of veterinarians from SANCCOB, Cape Town, South Africa. He said they are continuing to put salt and isolation of sick ones from healthy penguins to control the spread of the virus, as the virus needs to run its course, as there is no vaccine for it. The ministry of fisheries’ officers started visiting the Island weekly after the swab samples collected on penguins last year at Halifax Island in Lüderitz and tested by the Central Veterinary Laboratory, tested positive of Avian Influenza H5N8. Avian influenza refers to infection of birds with Avian Influenza Type A virus. It occurs naturally among wild birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird species. 
The H5N8 virus Type A cannot survive brine (salty) conditions. The officials pay regular visits if possible (once per week) to the island and repeat these procedures to avoid further spreading of the virus. They also carry biosecurity measures on the island, on board the research vessel (RV Anichab) and at the Seabird Rehabilitation Facility to avoid further spreading of the highly pathogenic virus.
The report indicated the death of penguins on Halifax Island was discovered mid December 2018 to date. More than 500 penguins, mostly adults have been reported dead even though chicks and juveniles are also affected.
Halifax Island is situated about 10 kilometres west of Lüderitz near Diaz Point, about 100 metres off the mainland.  It is the second most important breeding site for African penguins and is home to about 7 000 penguins that contribute to the entire population of about 26 000 penguins in Namibia. The African penguins are endangered seabirds in Namibia and they are endemic to Namibia and South Africa.

Import of poultry and its products into the district, a pocket area for poultry, has been tightened, while poultry owners have been asked to maintain a biosecurity plan.

“Transportation of poultry and its products is frequent through the district. So a tight measure has been kept for quarantine,” said Dr Parshuram Phuyal, officiating chief of Veterinary Hospital. Sample of 150 fowls have been sent to Kathmandu for test, he said.
A meeting of the bird flu control technical committee that was called following the detection of bird flu in Makawanpur assessed the risk of the avian influenza coming to the district. It has also asked the people and poultry farmers to maintain biosecurity, said Phuyal.
Fowl samples are collected two days each week and sent to the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Tripureshwor, said Dr Dayaram Chapagain, chief of the National Avian Disease Investigation Laboratory, Bharatpur. So far only low pathogenic H9 has been detected in the samples, he said.
The Nepal Egg Producers Association has also asked the people and poultry farmers to stay on alert. According to Nepal Poultry Entrepreneurs’ Forum, over 5 million eggs are produced across the country on a daily basis, and 850,000 kilograms of chicken.
Poultry farming has provided job opportunities to around 180,000 people across the country, and it contributes four percent to the gross domestic product, said poultry entrepreneur Madan Pokharel.

Oedekoven said state and federal animal health officials are working with the owner of the affected herd to investigate the disease and mitigate further infection.CWD was first documented in South Dakota in 2001, in free-ranging deer and elk near the Black Hills. This is the first case of CWD in a captive elk since 2001, the AP report said.According to a press release from Oedekoven's office, South Dakota required mandatory CWD testing for all captive cervids (deer and elk) from 1997 until 2012.

Fears of a bird flu outbreak gripped Odisha’s Cuttack after 12 dead ducks were tested positive of H5N1 virus on March 31, 2019. Around 500 ducks and chickens have been culled since and 6,000 eggs destroyed.
The ducks were tested after 224 of them died in a livestock breeding and dairy farm in Khapuria area of the city.
“After 224 ducks died in the farm on March 29, we collected samples of 18 of them and sent it to the Animal Disease Research Laboratory (ADRL) in Cuttack to ascertain the cause of death. Later, ADRL officials sent the samples to National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), Bhopal, who found the virus in 12 ducks,” said Loknath Behera, joint director, Animal Disease Research Laboratory, Cuttack. 
This is the first case of bird flu in Odisha this year. Such a scare has returned to the state after four months as the last one was reported in Sanasahi, Maluda, Alanda and Patharganj villages near Chilika lake in December.
“In Cuttack, so far, avian influenza remains confined to the duck population as no cases of any chicken or other birds being infected have been reported. We still culled more than 500 ducks and chickens within a kilometre of the farm and destroyed around 6,000 eggs. We also formed a rapid action team for this task. And, we are surveilling the 10-km area around Cuttack,” added Behera. 
The administration is spraying sodium in the surveillance zone and instructing people to not consume chicken and duck for three months. Also, a compensation of Rs 130 for a duck, Rs 90 for a locally-bread hen and Rs 70 for a poultry chicken will be paid to poultry farmers.
“Avian Influenza A (H5N1) is highly contagious and fatal. Most of the cases in which humans have been infected by the virus, which aren’t many, have resulted from people being in direct or close contact with H5N1-infected poultry or H5N1- contaminated surfaces,” added Dr Behera.

CUTTACK: The avian influenza has resurfaced in Odisha. This time, the outbreak has been reported from the Millennium City prompting bird culling and ban on poultry products. 
After some ducks of the Duck Breeding Centre of Livestock Breeding and Dairy Farm located at Khapuria died a few days back, the officials collected samples from the dead birds and sent those to the Bhopal-based National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases for test. The samples tested positive for the H5N1 virus on Friday. 

“Immediately after getting reports of bird flu, we took permission from district administration and culled all the 435 ducks inside the Duck Breeding Centre on Friday night. 
Besides, around 6,180 eggs and 3.5 quintals of bird food were destroyed on the same night,” said Bibekanada Mishra, an official at the Duck Fertilisation Centre adding that the culled ducks and the destroyed eggs and bird food were buried.
On Saturday, Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) convened an emergency meeting and ordered mass culling of birds within one km radius of the duck breeding centre.
As many as 10 Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) have been formed for culling, mopping, surveillance, disinfection and sanitation, said Cuttack CDVO Dr Premananda Rout adding that the drive for culling of chickens has been intensified in nearby localities and necessary steps taken to prevent bird flu from spreading to other areas.
Meanwhile, the Food Safety Department has put up notices in the area banning sale of poultry products. The prohibition will be in force for next three months. Residents of the city have been advised not to consume chicken and eggs.

 Aurangabad, Maharashtra, Feb 24 (UNI) Over 200 migratory 'shank' birds of red and green variety, were found dead in a lake at Gandheli near here in Central Maharashtra even as the animal husbandry department ruled out any symptoms of bird flu in them. A post-mortem report, conducted by the Animal Husbandry department (AHD), has revealed that the birds died of pneumonia, AHD Deputy Commissioner J M Doiphode said adding ''no symptoms of bird flu were found in the migratory birds.'' However, samples of their viscera have been sent to the disease investigation section of the state government laboratory at Aundh in Pune and Bhopal-based High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, he said. A sample of live bird is also being sent to the Bhopal laboratory, Mr Doiphode added. The AHD team has also collected water samples to verify the doubts whether the birds died of contaminated water, he said. The birds have been dying for the last few days and the Animal Husbandry department (AHD) team rushed the spot last evening when an alert villager informed them about the deaths, officials said. The officials also said these birds, normally found in the hilly Ladakh region as well as in Europe, mights have died over a period of a week or so. When contacted, ornithologist Dilip Yardi, who had visited the Gandheli lake today attributed the deaths of the birds to a suspected 'poisoning'. Meanwhile, Nisarg Mitra Mandal Aurangabad founder president Prof Vijay Diwan ruled out a possibility of 'bird-flu' behind the deaths of the migratory birds. ''Many of the other birds were found completely fine near the lake, which indicates that there is no possibility of bird flu,'' Mr Diwan argued. According to him, the delay in departure of these migratory birds may be one of the reason of their deaths. Since the mercury has been rising in the region now, the birds might have died of high temperature, he said. He also said, of these two varities, red shanks migrate to India mainly from Europe and green shanks from Tibet as well as Ladakh, after an acute cold followed by a snow-fall there. These birds find the Indian winter climate more suitable. However, they usually start their return journey before summer, he added. Meanwhile, a four member team of ornithologists from the city rushed the lake to take stock of the situation. The team is expected to collect water samples separately. UNI MPJ GK YA RK1726

In Europe, flu is at baseline or low intensity in 34 countries, with activity still reported as medium in 13 countries.Flu activity in western Asia saw an overall decrease, but levels are still elevated in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. In East Asia, flu showed signs of decline but is still above seasonal thresholds in China and Hong Kong. Meanwhile, South Korea is experiencing a second wave of flu activity caused by H3N2 and influenza B, following earlier activity from 2009 H1N1. In Southeast Asia, flu activity is still elevated in Thailand, with influenza B most frequently detected.In the Southern Hemisphere, flu is still at interseasonal levels, except for some parts of Australia that have been experiencing activity over the past several weeks.Apr 1 WHO global flu update Flu vaccine tied to lower mortality in heart failure patientsIn a study today in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, researchers combed through published data on all-cause mortality rates among heart failure patients who received the influenza vaccine and found that flu vaccination was associated with a 31% decreased risk of all-cause mortality in those patients. The effect was more prominent (51% lower risk) during influenza season.The authors drew from eight studies published since 2000, which included a total of 82,354 patients (average age of 65) with heart failure. They found that patients who had received seasonal flu vaccine had a reduced risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51 to 0.87), especially during flu season (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.69).""There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of hospitalization among vaccinated and non-vaccinated patients with heart failure (pooled hazard ratio of 0.62 favoring influenza   vaccination), which may be due to the relatively limited number of studies,"" the authors wrote.Influenza infection has been associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and an exacerbation of chronic cardiovascular conditions. Because of this and the evidence gained from this study, the authors recommend seasonal flu vaccines for eligible heart failure patients.

 “We do not have genome sequencing facility in our laboratory,” Dr Shakya said. “So we are sending the samples to a laboratory in Australia.”
 She informed that over 350 crows died of the H5N1 virus in recent weeks in the city. Samples of the dead crows were examined at the Central Veterinary Laboratory, which confirmed that the virus was responsible for their deaths.
 Rapid response teams deployed from the Department of Livestock Services have also culled over 100,000 chickens in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Kaski, Morang and Sunsari, following the confirmation of the virus in the last few weeks.
 The department said it had intensified surveillance to prevent the transfer of chickens from virus-hit areas to other places.
 In 2013, thousands of chickens were culled in various districts following the outbreak of the deadly virus.

An outbreak of bird flu has been confirmed in Kathmandu, but doctors have asked people not to panic as the virus is of low risk to humans.

Around 350 crows found dead in Lainchaur and Durbar Marg areas have tested positive for H5N1 strain of the disease, according to the Department of Livestock Services. The birds were found dead in the third week of March.
Similar strain of virus was found in different birds, including chicken, last year as well. “But this is the first time such a large number of dead crows had tested positive for H5N1 strain of the disease,” said DoLS Director General Bimal Kumar Nirmal.
People need not worry much about the outbreak of disease, as it does not generally kill people, according to Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, coordinator of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital at Teku. Bird flu also does not pose food safety risk to humans if meat and eggs infected with the disease are cooked at 70 degree Celsius before consuming.
It, however, may pose severe health problems to humans if the disease is not diagnosed and treated on time, Dr Pun said.
Humans can contract H5N1 virus from saliva, excretion and feathers of the infected birds. “So, stay away from dead birds,” said Nirmal. “If dead birds have to be picked up put on gloves, masks and other protective gears and inform authorities about dead birds.”
The detection of the bird flu virus in crows has worried many as this type of bird, unlike chicken, can fly, spreading the disease to other animals and even humans. Doctors have, thus, warned people to keep their pets, such as dogs and cats, away from dead birds.
“The dead birds may also fall into drinking water sources, contaminating them,” said Nirmal, requesting people to report these cases to authorities as soon as possible. Some of the symptoms of the disease, also referred to as avian influenza, are sore and aching throats, high evening fever, and reddening of eyes. Regular medication can keep the disease under control.
“The virus, however, cannot be eradicated once it is transmitted to humans. We can only control the virus from replicating to keep the disease under control,” said Dr Pun.
Nepal has been witnessing bird flu outbreaks since 2009. But most of the time this disease was seen in chicken. This year too chickens raised in places like Bhaktapur and Tarkeshwor Municipality were culled after they tested positive for H5N1 strain.
But on March 17, dead crows were spotted on the premises of Narayanhiti Palace Museum in Durbar Marg and British Council in Lainchaur. The DoLS, on March 21, confirmed that the dead crows were infected with the H5N1 strain of virus. “Crows are very vulnerable to the disease and die within a day of being infected,” said Nirmal, adding, “The outbreak is now under control.”

New reports over rising bird flu incidents are leaving Nepali livestock officials sleepless!
Alarmed at the rising rate of H5NI bird flu in Kathmandu, Nepal’s Livestock Department is preparing for serious measures to tackle the growing menace.
The Department has decided to send the samples of dead crows and chickens to Australia for genome sequencing, to confirm the occurrence of the disease and identify possible changes in the biology of the virus.

To tackle the spreading flu, the department has been holding strict surveillance to prevent the transporting of chicken from virus-hit areas to other places.
Nepal, as the World Organization of Animal Health, is liable to send samples for avian flu of H5N1 for genome sequencing, says Dr. Samjhana Kumari Shakya, Deputy Director General at the Department.
“We do not have genome sequencing facility in our laboratory. So, we are sending the samples to a laboratory in Australia,” Dr. Shakya said.
According to Shakya, over 350 crows died of H5N1 virus in recent weeks in Kathmandu alone. Samples of the dead crows examined at the Central Veterinary Laboratory confirmed the virus as the cause of deaths.

Besides, the rapid response has also recalled 100,000 chickens in various parts of the country: Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Makwanpur, Kaski, Morang, and Sunsari.
Past incidents show the intensity of avian flu in Nepal. 2013 saw thousands of chickens in Nepal across districts culled as a result of the virus outbreak.

Authorities quickly sent antiviral drugs and provided health education and hygiene and sanitization interventions to slow the spread of the outbreak.As part of the response, the CDC regional flu program in Thailand worked with Thailand's health ministry to send an emergency supply of oseltamivir from Thailand to Laos in less 24 hours. Health officials also redirected flu vaccine from Laos' ongoing seasonal flu campaign to the tribe, enabling more than 2,200 people to be vaccinated and achieving a 74% vaccination rate. The CDC said no new deaths have been reported, and the epidemic curve shows a decline.An investigation is underway into why the 2009 H1N1 outbreak was so deadly. However, the CDC added that rural, remote populations are often not vaccinated against seasonal flu and typically have little access to healthcare. Malnourishment and underlying medical conditions are additional risk factors, it said.The CDC said close connections between animals and people in rural Laos raise the risk of flu viruses spreading among people and animals, conditions that can give rise to novel flu viruses.

The outbreak was confirmed on April 8 through laboratory test from National Centre for Animal Health (NCAH), Serbithang, Thimphu.
No human contact was reported.
In response, a total of 1,130 poultry birds in the affected areas were culled, about 4,002 eggs disposed, 613kgs of feed disposed and 12 chicken coops destroyed.
The National Incident Command Committee (NICC) has activated the Incident Operation Centre (IOC) at Thromde Veterinary Hospital in Phuentsholing with the Rapid Response Team (RRT) from different ministries and agencies for immediate containment and response to the outbreak.
A press release from the ministry states, “As the disease is brought under control at the source of outbreak the public should not panic. The public is also advised to take precautions like washing of hands after handling poultry, chicken and eggs with soap and water.”
Program director of NCAH, Dr RB Gurung, the focal person of bird flu said the outbreak was reported in the field on April 6.
He said the outbreak is under control by about 80 percent yesterday. As the outbreak location was at the outskirt of town, there were not much vehicles plying, which made it easier, he added.
The response team also created awareness in the community. Vehicles plying out of the demarcated infected and restricted zone are also disinfected.
Dr RB Gurung said poultry farmers are cautioned to comply farm bio-security measures and not allow visitors into the farms without proper safety measures.
“We need to observe the outbreak area for one month,” Dr RB Gurung said.

They warned that actions are needed to improve surveillance and data sharing and to monitor environmental and climate precursors to outbreaks.Climate change is only one of many factors, which include globalization, socioeconomic development, urbanization, and changes in land use, said Jan Semenza, PhD, MPH, with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.Giovanni Rezza, MD, PhD, who directs the department of infectious diseases at the Instituto Superiore di Sanita in Rome, said the stark reality is that longer hot seasons will enlarge the seasonal window for the potential spread of vector-borne outbreak, favoring larger events. ""We must be prepared to deal with these tropical infections. Lessons from recent outbreaks of West Nile virus in North America and chikungunya in the Caribbean and Italy highlight the importance of assessing future vector-borne disease risks and preparing contingencies for future outbreaks.""The experts noted that the interplay between multiple drivers makes projecting disease burden challenging, but they said climate change has allowed mosquitoes and ticks to adapt, proliferate, and broach new areas, with examples including dengue outbreaks in France and Croatia, malaria in Greece, West Nile fever in southeast Europe, and chikungunya in Italy and France.Apr 13 ECCMID press release",2019-04-15 19:21:04.000000,done,

US officials have confirmed 555 measles cases so far in 2019, and the country is on pace to soon pass 2014 totals to reach the most cases since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.The experts explain that measles is highly contagious—90% of people who are not immune will contract the disease if exposed. And though most suffer a mild week-long illness, a significant proportion of cases are fatal. Measles is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable illness and death around the globe, with 100,000 cases attributed to the virus annually—but this year has already topped that number globally.Because measles is so contagious, herd immunity, which is achieved by 93% to 95% coverage, must be reached to stop transmission. Nearly complete protection is entirely attainable given the highly effective measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine.""Unlike many infectious diseases, measles is a public health problem with a clear scientific solution,"" Fauci said. But resistance to vaccination has resulted in a 31% increase in the number of measles cases reported globally between 2016 and 2017—and the rise will be even greater this year.Fauci and colleagues said, ""If this trend is not reversed, measles may rebound in full force in both the United States and other countries and regions where it had been eliminated."" They add that promoting measles vaccine is a societal obligation.Apr 17 N Engl J Med commentary  Study: Rates of high-grade cervical lesions decline after HPV vaccinationResearchers today in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Reports (MMWR) published the first-ever estimate of cervical precancers using population data of US women. From 2006 through 2018, detection rates of high-grade cervical lesions (CIN2+, with CIN referring to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) declined from 216,000 cases to 196,000, largely attributed to the use of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, they write.The decline was seen in women ages 18 to 24, and 76% of cases were attributable to nine-valent (nine-strain) HPV vaccine types. CIN2+ lesions are the most concerning and can lead to cervical cancer, and scientists use CIN2+ rates to monitor vaccine impact.In 2006 the HPV vaccine was licensed for use in women up the age of 26. Women ages 40 to 64 saw significant increased rates of CIN2+ during the study period than did younger cohorts, who were likely vaccinated with one of two HPV vaccines available for use. In 2016, coverage of more than one dose was 65.1%, and the recommended three-dose coverage was 43.0% for girls ages 13 through 17, the authors said.""In younger age groups, the decline in HPV 16/18-attributable CIN2+, targeted by the quadrivalent vaccine from 2006 to 2015, also reflects the impact of the U.S. HPV vaccination program,"" the authors said. ""Some of the increases in older age groups could be attributable to use of HPV testing, which is more sensitive than cytology, as part of cervical cancer screening, as has been predicted by modeling studies.""

The spread of the H5N8 strain of the avian flu virus in recent years has lead to the deaths of millions of birds in Europe and Asia as health officials have sought to contain the virus.
The strain is not known to have infected humans as of yet, but officials are concerned it could have a highly deadly potential if it does.
In 2016, the World Health Organization warned that the H5N8 virus was “rapidly spreading in Asia and Europe, causing deaths in wild birds and outbreaks in domestic poultry.”
Since then, major outbreaks have been reported across the Middle East and Africa.
Israeli and Palestinian growers have dealt with sporadic outbreaks of the virus over the years, with hundreds of thousands of birds culled to stop the virus from spreading.
In 2006, southern Israel’s poultry industry was brought nearly to the brink of collapse, growers said, after a number of culls following the discovery of bird flu.",2019-04-25 14:22:00.000000,done,

According to the OIE report, partial HA sequencing determined the H5 to be a LPAI virus of North American wild bird lineage, but further characterization is pending virus recovery. There have been no clinical signs of illness or increased mortality on the premises, the report said.
USDA's Animal & Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food & Agriculture are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and have implemented enhanced surveillance and testing related to this finding, the OIE report said.
Two additional commercial poultry premises associated with the initial premises have been quarantined and sampled for avian influenza virus, and the results are pending.
Control measures applied in the case include movement controls, surveillance and quarantine. 
LPAI viruses typically cause few or no clinical signs in infected poultry. The LPAI virus is excreted through infected birds’ feces and respiratory secretions and spreads primarily through direct contact among healthy and infected birds, according to APHIS. LPAI can also be spread through indirect contact with contaminated equipment and materials.
To prevent cases of LPAI, poultry producers must use special preventative measures and precautions on the farm, APHIS said. If LPAI is detected, farms must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Avian influenza viruses are inactivated by heat and drying. They are also very sensitive to most disinfectants and detergents. To ensure thorough disinfection, organic material must first be cleaned from the environment.
On the other hand, highly pathogenic avian influenza is a serious disease and requires rapid response because it is highly contagious and often fatal to chickens and turkeys, APHIS said.",2019-04-25 15:40:01.000000,done,

The report was funded by the Open Philanthropy Project.The group said as pandemic preparedness matures, integrating new vaccine platform technologies into countermeasure development has the potential to impact resilience to both global catastrophic biologic risks and other epidemic threats. They tie in findings from existing evidence, informational interviews, and a workshop held with subject matter experts. And they make five main recommendations that center around platform and nonplatform vaccine technology proliferation; focusing platform-based assessments on accelerating manufacturing rather than speeding regulatory developments; supporting traditional vaccine development; prioritizing mRNA-based vaccines; and giving special consideration to platform technologies, given market conditions.Apr 25 Center for Health Security news release Apr 25 Center for Health Security vaccine platform report High viral loads linked to fatal H5N1 casesA new study in Clinical Infectious Diseases uses nasal and fecal samples to estimate viral loads in human patients with avian influenza H5N1, finding that higher viral loads are linked to fatal cases.The study was based in Indonesia.

The aim of the study was to determine whether a change in empiric therapy for leukemia patients with febrile neutropenia had any impact on the incidence of hospital-acquired VRE colonization. In September 2015, in response to a previous study that found use of a carbapenem for empiric therapy of febrile neutropenia was an independent risk factor for VRE colonization in leukemia patients, the hospital changed the empiric antibiotic from a carbapenem to a cycling regimen of cefepime and piperacillin/tazobactam.Of the 342 patients, 214 were admitted during the carbapenem period and 128 during the cycling period. Weekly surveillance for VRE stool colonization showed that the change in empiric antibiotics was associated with a significant decrease in VRE colonization (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.66). In addition, an analysis of representative stool samples found there was a switch in the dominant VRE multilocus sequence types (from ST664 and ST967 prior to the change to ST186 and ST896 after) and some changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. Patients during the carbapenem period also had longer hospital stays and durations of severe neutropenia and 10% higher hospital costs.""In conclusion, less carbapenem use was associated with a reduction in VRE colonization, a decreased duration of neutropenia, and a decrease in hospital length of hospital stay, reduced costs, as well as possibly beneficial effects on potentially important gastrointestinal microbiota such as Blautia spp,"" the authors of the study write.May 3 Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol abstract Afghanistan and Pakistan report more polio casesIn its latest weekly update, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) today reported three more wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases, one from Afghanistan and two from Pakistan.

Dubai: The environmental ministry in the UAE on Sunday lifted the ban on all imports of live domestic and wild birds from Kuwait following a bird flu scare last February. 

According to a notice issued by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MoCCAE), is once again safe to import domestic and wild live birds, ornamental birds, chicks, hatching and table eggs, poultry meat, and their thermally non-treated products from Kuwait. 

The decision to implement the ban was carried out following a notification from the Emergency Centre for Transboundary Animal Diseases of the outbreak of a highly contagious strain of bird flu (H5N8) in Kuwait. 

The MoCCAE said the ban would be in place until the outbreak was brought under control.

Researchers based at McMaster University described their findings today in Scientific Reports.The new system combines active vaccine ingredients with a sugary gel containing pullulan and trehalose that had already been developed by McMaster chemical engineers as an edible coating to prolong the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. The technique adds a marginal cost to preparing the vaccine, but eliminates nearly all the transport cost, which can make up 80% of the total cost of the vaccine.The vaccine can be stored at temperatures as high as 104°F (40°C) for 8 weeks or more. The method stores the active component in a tiny one-dose container filled with the sugar-gel combination that seals the vaccine. When administering the vaccine, the clinician reconstitutes it with water as he or she normally would.Ali Ashkar, DVM, PhD, study coauthor and professor of pathology and molecular medicine at McMaster said in a press release from the university, ""You can spend all kinds of money developing a vaccine, but if it is deactivated by high temperature an hour before you can give it to someone, it doesn't matter.""The team successfully used the system on two sample vaccines using influenza and herpes simplex to inoculate mice.

Researchers from the University of Georgia, the University of Connecticut, and the US Department of Agriculture published their findings yesterday in the preprint server bioRxiv.To learn more about what fueled the outbreak, the group analyzed 182 full-genome H5N2 sequences collected from commercial layer and turkey farms hit by the outbreaks and then factored the information into models that included epidemiologic and geographic information.The investigators found that layer chickens and turkeys seemed to represent two separate host populations that interacted with each other, but did not receive the virus from an ongoing external source. Their models suggested that layer chicken farms were infectious much longer than turkey farms, possibly explaining why the transmission rate from chicken farms to turkey farms was higher than from turkey farms to chicken farms. Though turkeys survived longer than chickens, turkey premises were depopulated more quickly than layer facilities.The researchers note that their genetic findings support earlier findings that virus spread among Minnesota's poultry farms were distance-dependent. High road-density findings correlate with better logistic connectivity between farms, boosting the chances that an infected farm will export the virus to nearby farms and counties, a factor seen in earlier poultry outbreaks overseas. One factor they looked at that had a relatively small effect size was the proportion of a county covered by surface water, which in countries like China has been associated with greater avian influenza dispersal due to waterfowl migration.Implications for future surveillance and control may be that though wild birds can initially introduce the virus, outbreaks can be maintained without additional ones, the team wrote. Biosecurity measures may have been enough to prevent continued introductions from outside sources, but may not have been as effective against local farm-to-farm transmission. The authors point out that biosecurity factors might explain why the Midwest's broiler chicken industry was spared from the outbreak.A better understanding of how affected farms are connected would help with control efforts, they say. ""With the knowledge of how these farms share personnel and equipment, future outbreaks could be contained by disruption of the transportation network,"" they wrote.May 21 bioRxiv study",2019-05-22 19:15:18.000000,irrelevant,research abt bird flu

The outbreak was confirmed at a farm in Jagang province in North Korea near the country’s border with China on May 25, South Korea’s Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said in a statement. More than 20 hogs were culled and more than 70 pigs died from the virus, the ministry said. The highly contagious disease, which is fatal to pigs but does not affect humans, has spread rapidly across China since it was first detected in the country last August and has also been reported in Vietnam. There is no vaccine against it. The South Korean government held a meeting on Friday to discuss ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Measures will include stepping up disinfection near the border areas between the two Koreas, the ministry said. “Although the outbreak occurred in Jagang near North Korea’s border with China, there is a possibility that the virus could spread to the South and we plan to carry out extra disinfection measures,” Oh Soon-min, director general of the agriculture ministry said at a press briefing. Separately, South Korea’s unification ministry said it would communicate with North Korea through an inter-Korean liaison office to work on detailed protection measures. Pork is a popular meat among South Koreans and is cheaper than beef. The country had about 12 million pigs in the first quarter of the year, according to data from Statistics Korea. North Korea has not confirmed the swine fever outbreak, but the state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Friday reported three articles about the risks of the virus and how rapidly it is spreading around the world.

Taipei, June 10 (CNA) The Council of Agriculture (COA) warned Monday of the potential damage that could be caused by crop-destroying fall armyworm, stressing that it is critical to wipe out the harmful insect across Taiwan in the coming two or three weeks.""It is imperative to stem out all fall armyworms throughout the country, because it could create much more trouble than avian flu,"" COA Deputy Minister Huang Chin-cheng (黃金城) said at a news conference.The arrival of fall armyworms could reduce the yield of wheat, corn, sorghum and rice crops by 20-30 percent and affect 45 percent of the cultivation of those crops, said Feng Hai-tung (馮海東), head of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine.As part of government efforts to terminate fall armyworms, 500 traps using pheromones -- chemical substances produced by an animal that affect the behavior of others of its species -- have been installed across the country, he said.Given that an appropriate use of pesticides can help farmers eliminate fall armyworms, which are in fact caterpillars, the COA has recommended 11 specific pesticides, including Neem oil and Bacillus thuningiensis, on its website to achieve the goal, Feng said.The COA issued the warning after a harmful species of Lepidoptera found on a farm in Miaoli County on Saturday was confirmed as the fall armyworm on Monday -- the first such case in Taiwan.Later Monday, the COA's Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute reported that the highly destructive insect seemed to have also appeared in Yilan and Chiayi counties, verification of which will be made public Tuesday.On May 13, the COA held a news conference warning about the possible arrival of the fall armyworm in Taiwan.If the insect arrives in large numbers, sweet corn and rice fields on Taiwan proper and sorghum and wheat fields in Kinmen are vulnerable, and could potentially result in an annual loss of up to NT$3.5 billion (US$111.46 million), according to the COA .Since 2016, the fall armyworm has spread from America to Africa, and from Africa to Asia, including Southeast Asia and India in 2017-2018 and China in 2019.According to Chiang Ming-yao (江明耀), a researcher at the Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute, the latest information shows that 18 provinces in China, including Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, have already reported economic losses as a result of the spread of the ravenous caterpillar.

According to Yilan's Agriculture Department, more than 20 worms discovered by a farmer on his organic corn field Monday have been confirmed as the highly destructive fall armyworm.
The corn was destroyed and buried by the county authorities the same afternoon in an effort to prevent the further spread of the harmful insect pest.
Later on Wednesday, the fall armyworm was also confirmed by the COA as having been found on a corn field in Chiayi, the crop from which was immediately destroyed and buried.
Fields within 200 meters of the corn field were sprayed with pesticides in an effort to wipe out the insect pest, a county official said.
According to the COA, two different types of fall armyworm have been identified, one that primarily attacks corn, the other rice crops.
Officials said the one that targets corn could have come from China, while the other species might have flown from China or Vietnam.
Meanwhile, seven additional cases of the insect pest were reported in Yunlin, Chiayi and Yilan counties by late Wednesday, the COA said.
The fall armyworm was first confirmed to have appeared on a farm in Miaoli County Monday -- the first such case in Taiwan, after a visitor to the farm reported it to the local government.
""It is imperative that we stem an all-out invasion by fall armyworms across the country, because they could create much more trouble than avian flu,"" Council of Agriculture (COA) Deputy Minister Huang Chin-cheng (黃金城) said at a news conference Monday.
The arrival of fall armyworms could reduce the yield of wheat, corn, sorghum and rice crops by 20-30 percent and impact 45 percent of the cultivation of those crops, said Feng Hai-tung (馮海東), head of the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, on the same occasion.
With officials increasingly concerned about the arrival of the invasive fall armyworm in Taiwan, the COA has installed 500 pheromone traps around the country as part of an effort to eliminate the pest, he said.
If the fall armyworm arrives in large numbers, sweet corn and rice fields on Taiwan proper and sorghum and wheat fields in Kinmen are particularly vulnerable, with potential annual losses of up to NT$3.5 billion (US$111.46 million), according to the COA.

The outbreak began on Jun 21, and the virus sickened 22 ostriches in a flock of 1,440. As is typical for ostrich farms, no birds were destroyed, but measures such as isolation of sick birds and disinfection of the surroundings have been implemented.On Jul 9 the OIE posted a report on high-path H7N3 causing three poultry outbreaks in Mexico, in backyard flocks in Hidalgo, Jalisco, and Gunajuato states, all in the central part of the country. The outbreaks began in early to mid June, with the largest, in Hidalgo, completely wiping out a flock of 1,000 poultry. Among the three outbreaks, the disease killed 1,035 among 1,260 birds. Authorities euthanized the remainder. They said the states have a low prevalence of avian flu.Taiwan officials, meanwhile, on Jul 8 reported two outbreaks of low-pathogenic H5N2 that actually happened in 2017, and on Jul 4 they confirmed five recent outbreaks of the highly pathogenic version of H5N2.The low-path outbreaks involved chicken farms in Pingtung and Yunlin counties and began in April and December of 2017. Retrospective analysis identified the strain recently. Of 44,564 birds in the two flocks, only 64 died. Per protocol, however, all surviving birds were culled.The high-path H5N2 outbreaks began from Jun 24 to Jun 28 on three farms in Yunlin County and two in Changhua County.

Bala Lukshi,the Permanent Secretary, Bauchi State Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, said this in Bauchi in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).
“We recorded what is called Equine influenza. a viral disease. But this species is specific because every species of animal has its own influenza.
“We have Avian influenza which was recorded in 2006 in Nigeria then after which other countries recorded swine influenza for pigs.
“But this year, for the first time we recorded Equine Influenza in six states in Nigeria and Bauchi State happened to be one of the affected states,” Lukshi said.
“We first recorded the disease in Gamawa Local Government and from all indications the disease came through Niger Republic.
“In Gamawa we have livestock market where horses and donkeys are being sold and we believe is the route where this disease came to our state.
“Other affected areas are along the borderline with Niger Republic, but we were able to tackle it,” he said.
According to him, the ministry sent a team of experts who took samples to the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom, in Plateau and were found positive.
“We treated the affected animals. Fortunately, it is not like Avian Influenza, so we were able to contain the disease and restrict it within the affected areas.

“Specifically, it affects only donkeys, horses and other animals such as Zebra because it is generic and only affects such species.
“We recorded some dead animals but it was very low because the outbreak was reported early and we took proactive action,” Mr Lukshi stressed.
He explained that the mortality rate recorded was low though the morbidity was very high and wide because it spread very fast and affects the performances of horses and other animals.
“It is very dangerous where you have horses for Polo races. Bauchi metropolis is known for and has horses for tournaments especially when it affects the respiratory tracts and other parts.
“The symptoms include oral lesions, blistering, drooling and can cause blisters and sores in the mouth, tongue, muzzle, teats or hooves of horses.
He, therefore, called on horse owners to remain vigilant to the clinical signs of the flu and boost horse’s vaccination if it was given more than six months ago.
“They should isolate new arrivals on their yard’s and those returning from shows or tournaments.”
Mr Lukshi said that the state in the period under review witnessed Avian Influenza (for birds) in Bauchi, Toro and other Local Government Councils.
“We also recorded disease that affects cows, goats and other ruminants, but the morbidity rate was very low because of vaccination exercise conducted against the disease in late 2018.
“We have kept our teams of experts on surveillance at various posts and they were yet to record new cases,” he said.

It advised the public to seek treatment at the nearest health facility if one experiences cold-like symptoms with abrupt or sudden onset of sore throat, fever, headache, muscle-aches and chest discomfort or congestion and cough.
The ministry however cautioned the infected people to limit contact with others as much as possible to keep from spreading the flu germs, cover their nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing.
""Wash your hands often with soap and water, clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs like the flu and drink a plenty of warm fluids and keep warm,"" it said.
The deceased was diagnosed with flu like symptoms, chest pain and difficulty in breathing before succumbing to the disease.
He was subsequently admitted to the high dependency unit (HDU) with worsening symptoms and got respiratory failure and progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage and passed on July 19.
The deceased had earlier traveled to Watamu at the coastal Kenya and stayed for seven days before returning to Nairobi.
According to the ministry, none of the people the deceased stayed within Watamu has reported being ill but unfortunately two of his relatives in Nairobi are reportedly unwell and are undergoing treatment.
The two who are admitted includes the deceased mother and a medical officer attached to an hospital in Nairobi.
Meanwhile, the ministry has dispatched a rapid response team to undertake field investigation of this public health event and that cases presenting with signs and symptoms of the disease are currently being managed appropriately.",2019-07-22 12:48:52.000000,irrelevant / human case,

 The Ministry of Health has dispelled fears of a possible swine flu outbreak.
In a statement, the ministry said the strain of flu responsible for the death of a teenager two days ago was neither avian nor swine flu, as earlier reported.
According to the ministry, the death was due to a severe acute respiratory infection (Sari).
SEE ALSO :Threat of Ebola is present, lets maintain vigilance at all timesIt had previously been claimed that the 17-year-old boy succumbed to swine flu at a hospital in Nairobi.
The teenager, as The Standard learnt, had been taken to the hospital with high fever and chest pain. His condition worsened and he was transferred to the high dependency unit on Thursday. He died on Friday.
According to the incident report, the patient died of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The report indicated that the boy had been in Watamu, Mombasa two weeks ago before he returned to Nairobi where he fell ill.
A doctor who was treating the teen is said to have been infected and hospitalised. The boy’s mother, who took him to the hospital, and his sister are also hospitalised.
His father was not affected.
The ministry said the three patients were responding well to treatment and one of them (the sister) was being treated as an outpatient because she was exhibiting mild symptoms.
The ministry noted that data from surveillance over the last 10 years showed that influenza viruses circulated throughout the year, with peaks of activity from February to April and June to November.
Flu viruses
“What we are witnessing currently is the heightened circulation of influenza flu viruses in Kenya.”
In March last year, a suspected case of avian flu was reported in Nanyuki. A five-year-old boy died.
The Sari virus is just as dangerous as the swine flu. Some of the symptoms listed by the World Health Organisation (WHO) are high temperatures of 38 degrees or above, a cough that lasts 10 days, and difficulty in breathing.
Both flu strains are spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected person. People with lower immunity like children, the elderly and those naturally prone to viral infections are at high risk.
The ministry advised anyone exhibiting symptoms, including sore throat, headache and muscle aches, to seek treatment. “With common cold fever is rare, onset of symptoms quite gradual and there are rarely any aches or chills,” health officials said.
Other precautions include high standards of sanitation practices like washing hands, disinfecting objects and surfaces, and drinking plenty of fluids.
Swine flu, which originates from pigs, was declared a pandemic in 2009 by WHO after the virus ravaged Asian countries and spread to the human population.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that swine flu has infected nearly 61 million persons in the US and caused the deaths of 12,469. Globally, 575,400 people have died.

Infected poultry were culled to prevent the spread of the avian flu (Photo: VNA)

 
Hanoi (VNA) – Outbreaks of A/H5N1
and A/H5N6 avian influenza, which is transmittable to humans, have been
reported in 13 communes of 11 localities nationwide from the start of 2019, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. 

More than 23,000 fowl were culled in the
period.

The flu is forecast to widely spread in the
remaining months because of changing weather and surging poultry transportation
in time ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.

Therefore, localities across the country
are asked to carry out measures to prevent the spread of the flu in line with
the Law on Animal Health, and create optimal conditions for poultry farming in
a bid to make up for the decrease in pork production caused by the African
swine fever.

They are also instructed to devise plans
and mobilise forces to prevent the disease, spray chemicals in high-risk
localities and keep a close watch on the growth of local poultry, especially in
previously-affected areas.

Vietnam first detected the avian flu virus
A/H5N1 in December 2003 on both human and poultry. Several new strains of the
virus, such as A/H7N9, A/H5N2 and A/H5N8, could enter the country through
transportation, business and consumption of illegally imported poultry products
of unclear origins, especially in the northern border provinces.-VNA",2019-07-26 02:20:00.000000,irrelevant,

More than 23,000 fowl have been culled so far this year, the agency reported quoting the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development.
The bird flu is forecast to widely spread in the remaining months of this year due to changing weather and surging poultry transportation in time ahead of the lunar new year holiday.
Cities and provinces across Vietnam have been instructed to devise plans and mobilize forces to prevent the disease, spray chemicals in high-risk areas and keep a close watch on the growth of their poultry populations.
Vietnam first detected bird flu virus strain of A/H5N1 in December 2003 on both humans and poultry. Several new strains of the virus, such as A/H7N9, A/H5N2 and A/H5N8, could enter the country through transportation, business and consumption of smuggled poultry products of unclear origins, the agency reported.
More than 45 million poultry in Vietnam were culled between 2003 and 2006. Since then, hundreds of thousands of fowls have been killed each year.
In the 2004-2014 period, 127 people in Vietnam were infected with H5N1, including 64 fatalities, according to the ministry. The country has detected no new human cases of H5N1 infection since 2014.
Early this year, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc unveiled a national plan on bird flu prevention and control for the 2019-2025 period. The plan seeks to prevent and control bird flu outbreaks and help form disease-free poultry farming zones and chains.
Authorized forces are requested to control outbreaks through early detection and a swift dealing with infected hotbeds to prevent them from spreading.
The plan also tasks them with preventing new and dangerous flu strains from entering or spreading in Vietnam, while vaccinating at least 80 percent of poultry, the agency reported.",2019-07-26 08:06:04.000000,irrelevant,

Two of the outbreaks occurred at farms in Queretaro state in central Mexico, one was in backyard birds in neighboring Guanajuato state, and one involved backyard poultry in Veracruz state on the country's eastern coast.The events began from Jun 29 to Jul 10, killing 4,282 of 195,852 susceptible birds. In all but one of the outbreaks, the virus was detected following deaths and clinical signs in birds. The third detection was part of epidemiologic surveillance in healthy birds at a fattening farm.Authorities culled 17,369 poultry as part of the response to the outbreaks, which are part of sporadic detections of the virus in Mexico since April.Jul 27 OIE report on H7N3 in Mexico Study finds minimal Tamiflu impact in low-risk groupsA study on the impact of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) in adults at low risk for flu complications found that the medication decreased viral shedding at day 3, but did not significantly shorten the time until clinical symptom resolution.The multicenter randomized, double-blind study included adults ages 18 to 64 years old at 42 clinical centers in Thailand, the United States, and Argentina from January 2012 to October 2017. An international research team published its findings Jul 27 in Clinical Infectious Diseases.Of 716 adults screened for flu, 558 were randomized, and 501 were confirmed to have the virus. Participants were randomized to receive either 75 milligrams of oseltamivir or placebo twice daily for 5 days. The main goal of the study was to gauge detectable virus by nasopharyngeal swab sampling at day 3, and results were available for 449 of 455 people in the primary analysis group.Of 220 subjects in the oseltamivir group, 99 of 220 (45%) had detectable virus at day 3, compared with 131 of 229 (57.2%) in the placebo group, for an absolute difference of -12.2. Meanwhile, the median time to symptom resolution was 79 hours for the oseltamivir group and 84 hours for the placebo arm, a difference that was nonsignificant (P = 0.34).The authors said their study didn't show the same clinical benefits for low-risk patients as earlier licensing trials, but they said their results were consistent with findings from a Cochrane meta-analysis, which found considerable variation. They pointed out that their study population was different than earlier licensure studies, including that a much greater percentage of patients in the new study had been sick with influenza B. They said that the efficacy of the drug against influenza B has been questionable, and their data show little or no clinical or virologic efficacy against the influenza B in low-risk groups. The team also said their study enrolled patients from a broader group than earlier licensing trials, which focused on American and European participants.They said, however, that their study should be used to question the drug's use in most populations, with many studies supporting clinical benefits with treatment recommendations justified for those who are very sick or who are at high risk for complications. They added that the minimal benefits they found should raise a caution about automatically extending treatment recommendations to low-risk groups.Jul 27 Clin Infect Dis abstract",2019-07-29 19:42:20.000000,done,
