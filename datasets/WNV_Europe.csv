A 68-year-old man from Dolj County has died after being infected with the West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes. The patient had the first signs of illness on August 25, and the death occurred two days later. It is the first confirmed death this year in Romania due to this infection that causes meningitis and encephalitis and which in other years has caused real epidemics. In Romania, four confirmed cases of West Nile virus have been registered so far, informs the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases.The first confirmed case of West Nile was announced on August 6, in a woman from Olt County. The cases were registered in the following age groups: one case in the category 40-49 years (the woman from Olt), two cases in the category 60-69 years (including one resulting in death) and one case in the category 70-79 years. It is about two women and two men, all from urban areas, from Bacau counties (1 case), Olt (1 case), Dolj (1 case), and one case is in Bucharest.How can we avoid infection with West NileThis disease, transmitted through the mosquito-tiger sting, can also manifest itself through severe forms, such as meningitis or encephalitis. In July, the Cantacuzino Institute had confirmed the presence of tiger mosquitoes, which transmit West Nile virus, also in Bucharest, and the City Hall then transmitted that it would intensify anti-mosquito treatments. 80% of people infected with West Nile do not show symptoms, but when the infection sets in you have to be very careful, because the disease begins with the symptoms of a flu, that is, high fever and intense headache, and in severe cases even neurological symptoms, vomiting, rashes, photophobia, chills or chronic fatigue and muscle weakness appear.

In 2018, romania recorded 36 deaths across the country due to West Nile virus. Europe faced an extremely high number of West Nile virus cases that year. From the beginning of 2018 to September 6, more than 1,000 cases were registered: almost 800 in EU member countries and another 314 in states that are not part of the community bloc. In 1996, Romania faced the most severe West Nile meningitis epidemic in Europe. Officially, more than 300 cases were recorded then.

According to the National Center for Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases within the National Institute of Public Health, the three cases of West Nile infection have been confirmed in Olt, Bacau and Bucharest counties.
The mayor of the capital said that he started later the disinsection campaign this year, due to the lack of money, but that it will be more intense, with 14 treatments to be carried out, double compared to previous years, and now the authorities are at the fifth campaign. He noted that in areas where mosquitoes have been identified that can transmit West Nile virus, the campaign is being stepped up.
""From the lack of money, from the lack of budget and therefore from the money. We are already, precisely because it was a delay at the beginning, the pace of treatments is higher. In previous years there were seven treatments for mosquitoes, this year we will do 14 and we are at the fifth. Both the Cantacuzino Institute and we have those traps for mosquitoes that can say which are the species of mosquitoes that circulate, live in certain areas of Bucharest and the face and the complaints from the Institute, and from our operators, from West Nile in the Heroes area, one, and the second in the Crângaşi area, we intensified there.

9V6PAYA31Q,Mosquitoes are carriers of the disease. What conditions do you risk,"Mosquitoes are carriers of the disease. What conditions do you risk

We entered the month of Oven, when temperatures will reach maximum values, which will attract those small insects, mosquitoes, which always bite and buzz and give everyone headaches. Unfortunately, mosquitoes can be carriers of diseases and infect you, by a simple sting. However, in normal situations, the mosquito bite is cured by applying a cream with hydrocortisone. According to Dr. Mirela Tumbea, family doctor, when the pain appears, the area swells, and this is a sign that the bite must be taken seriously. The doctor said that there is a whole list of diseases that you can contract from insects, but we will mention only a few, the most common. Lyme disease is one of them, and the main symptoms that an infected person can manifest are irritation, headaches, manifestations similar to the flu, etc. Those who suffer from Dengue fever have persistent fever, severe headaches, profuse sweating, pain behind the eyes, light bleeding. West Nyle virus is sometimes asymptomatic, but in rare cases it is manifested by fever. The risk of severe illness and death is highest for people over 50 years of age or with immune deficiencies, although infection can occur at any age. ""The manifestations of West Nile virus infection are diverse, from those resembling a simple cold, to signs of meningo-encephalitis. Alarm signs, which require presentation to the doctor, are high fever, accompanied by intense headache and vomiting. Less often, it can reach meningitis or encephalitis. In the case of these people, the disease is manifested by strong fever, excruciating headaches, stiffening of the neck, disorientation, coma, convulsions, muscle weakness, problems with vision, numbness and even paralysis. In this case, the neurological effects can be permanent, and the recovery is long and arduous. In case you have them, you need to go to the doctor urgently,"" the doctor explained. Mosquitoes are attracted to a certain blood group Lyme disease, also called the disease with a thousand faces because of the fact that it affects the entire body, misleads people. Why? Because her symptoms are similar to those of other diseases. Thus, typical symptoms and signs include fever, headache, fatigue and a characteristic condition called migratory erythema. Unfortunately, untreated, the infection can affect the joints, heart and nervous system. Most cases of Lyme disease can be successfully treated with antibiotics. Specialists say that the blood group is an important factor in attracting mosquitoes, and people with group O are most attacked by these insects. At the opposite pole, people with blood group A are the least hunted by mosquitoes. It is not known exactly why people with blood group O attract mosquitoes more, but studies show that this is how it happens. One possible explanation could be that females rely on proteins in our blood, to produce fertile eggs. Unfortunately, there is no food or medicine that will remove mosquitoes. As a result, the stories that garlic or bananas drive away mosquitoes are mere myths.",https://www.cugetliber.ro/stiri-sanatate-tantarii-sunt-purtatori-de-boala-ce-afectiuni-riscati-daca-sunteti-ciupiti-431983,EN,RO,2022-05-29 01:56:28,2021-07-02 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

Two other cases of infection with West Nile virus - which is transmitted through the mosquito bite - have been registered in Romania, being patients from Bucharest and Giurgiu, the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) announced on Thursday. Asian tiger mosquito, carrier of West NileFoto virus: Wikimedia Commons - James Gathany/CDCFrom the start of monitoring West Nile virus infection on June 7, and until September 15, there have been 7 cases of West Nile virus infection and one person has died, according to the INSP.
The 7 cases were registered in Bucharest (3 cases) and bacau (1 case), Olt (1case), Dolj (1 case) and Giurgiu (1 case) counties. As for the death, recorded at the beginning of September, we are talking about a 63-year-old man from Dolj.Rare forms are few, but it is good for patients to come to the hospitalDr. Simin Aysel Florescu, primary physician of infectious diseases at victor Babes Hospital in the capital, explained for News.ro that every year there are cases of infection with West Nile disease and that the serious forms are very few in relation to the total number of infections. When symptoms appear, however, it is good for patients to come to the hospital for treatment. Dr. Florescu says that the symptomatology of West Nile's disease can be confused with that given by the COVID-19 disease. For West Nile, however, there is no vaccine, as there is for SARS COV 2 infection.

""West Nile virus infection is a disease fortunately with a small number of serious cases in which asymtomatic or very mild forms of the disease are extremely common. It is a disease that has been known for a long time in our geographical space, every year there are some cases of West Nile infection in the country, especially in the southern countries, and the forms that end up in the hospital are very few compared to the total number of infections. Usually, elderly people who have meningo-encephalitis problems come to the hospital, because otherwise it can also manifest itself as a simple febrile disease, it is not something to be scared of necessarily, but obviously, given that it is a vector-borne disease it is good to take care of these cases, it is good to apply disinsection procedures,  And if we stay at the block and if we stay at the house, let's avoid mosquito bites during this period as much as possible. There are several types of clinical manifestations, those with the appearance of meningo-encephalitis are very few compared to the total number of infections. When there is a serious symptomatology - fever, headache, vomiting - we always have to come to the attention of a doctor, and given that we are in the midst of a SARS COV 2 pandemic, testing is basically routine at the moment. There is a screening of these cases with fever, with symptoms similar to SARS COV 2 infection, yes, if it is a disease with visible damage, with fever, with muscle pain, then, yes, obviously, every doctor who sees such a patient can test it. For West Nile we do not have an etiological treatment, unfortunately, only a pathogenetic and symptomatic treatment, supporting vital functions, depending on the severity of the case. Antithermal, if it is about vomiting, infusions, hydration, depending on the severity of each case. For West Nile we do not have a vaccine as we have for SARS COV 2"", explained the primary infectious disease doctor Simin Aysel Florescu.Insp recommendations for the population The INSP recommendations for the population are as follows: to avoid exposure to mosquitoes, wearing long-sleeved clothing and long pants, to use mosquito repellent chemicals, to prevent mosquitoes from entering the house (through protective nets on the windows),  ensure the dewatering of water puddles around the household, remove containers of stale water and household garbage from the household.",https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-25042809-alte-doua-cazuri-infectie-virusul-west-nile-raportate-romania-care-sunt-simptomele-infectiei-west-nile.htm,EN,RO,2022-04-14 01:33:59,2021-09-16 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

Warning from public health specialists. Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus have been discovered in Bucharest, but the mayor of The Capital announces that there have been no cases of infections in people. Doctors warn that 20% of people who get sick can develop serious forms. Symptoms include headaches, vomiting and fever. Traps for mosquitoes were mounted in 16 areas of all sectors of the Capital. Following the analyzes made to the captured insects, the specialists are trying to detect the presence of West Nile virus.Two positive samples have been detected in recent days in Bucharest, but no case of infection has been recorded. Doctors say West Nile virus is not transmitted from human to human. Elena Fălcuță - scientific researcher Cantacuzino Institute: For the vast majority of the population, the virus is asymptomatic. 1 in 5 cases may develop fever with headache, diarrhea, vomiting, and 1 in 150 people may develop infections of the central nervous system. Very seriously, immunocompromised people who have other diseases on the background can become infected and some unfortunate cases can end in death.Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus have been detected in the Crângași and Universitate-Eroilor areas. In this context, the mayor of the capital says that the disinsection actions have been intensified. Nicușor Dan - the general mayor of the capital: We went mainly to the parks, to Cismigiu and then to the whole area. The prefect claims that the disinsection plan works properly in Bucharest, but it was not started in time. Alin Stoica - prefect of the capital: Unfortunately, on this area there was a delay generated by an inability to control the companies or an indecision on the municipal companies and that is why the activity started late. Initially, no budgets were provided for those companies, but it is not easy to take the activity of that company, to internalize it. Already the company is working. In Romania, there have been no mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus since 2019, when 66 cases of infection and 8 deaths were recorded.

EKSUPFKP8E,"The black fungus, the disease that can leave you without eyes, has also appeared in Romania","The black fungus, the disease that can leave you without eyes, has also appeared in Romania

Thousands of cases of ""black fungus"" infection were reported in India in the early part of the year among patients who had COVID-19, many of whom were left without eyes. Doctors believe that the fungal infection is very strong in the body of patients weakened by the fight with the coronavirus, according to The Times.
Unfortunately, the first cases of black fungus (mucoromycosis) also appeared in Romania, in post-Covid-19 patients.
Six cases of mucormycosis were diagnosed, in just one month, at the Institute of Phonoaudiology and ENT Functional Surgery ""Prof. Dr. D. Hociotă"" in Bucharest, in patients who have passed through the Covid 19 disease. Doctors point out that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of patients diagnosed with mucoromycosis has increased significantly.
""In the hospital, we have had, in 15 years, only four cases of mucormycosis and we are a center with high addressability. Now, we've had six cases in a single month. So, clearly, their number has increased significantly and we still expect to identify such cases of mucormicosis. Most of them were diabetic patients, but we also had non-diabetic patients, who had had treatments with high doses of glucocorticoids"", said Associate Professor Razvan Hainăroşie, PhD, medical director of the Institute of Phonoaudiology and ENT Functional Surgery ""Prof. Dr. D. Hociotă"" in Bucharest, in an interview for Ro Health Review.
According to Ro Vaccination, of the six patients diagnosed with mucormycosis, four had a favorable evolution, one died, and another is in intensive care after being operated on. As a rule, mucoromycosis infection was identified a month, a month and a half after the patients were cured of COVID-19. Doctors say that the age of diagnosed patients is decreasing.
Specialists state that the black fungus affects the sinuses, brain and lungs and can be fatal for dia patients
According to statistics, rhinosinusal mucormycosis has a mortality index of between 36 and 40 percent, while in the case of pulmonary mucormycosis, the mortality index varies between 75 and 100%. That is why, doctors say, the early identification of mucoromycosis is extremely important, and the initiation of treatment is essential.
Symptoms of the disease
The most common symptoms seen in patients with mucoromycosis associated with Covid-19 were facial pain, palpebral ptosis, decreased visual acuity and even loss of vision, sinus damage at risk of cerebral and pulmonary enlargement. The evolution can be fatal in the case of the patient with diabetes and low immunity.
Recommendation: The Omicron version arrived in Constanta
The disease is not contagious, which means that it can not be spread as a result of contact with humans or infected animals.
Mucoromycosis is a rare and extremely dangerous fungal infection that attacks the nose, eyes, and sometimes the brain.
Subsequently, cases of mucormycosis were reported in states across the globe, such as Chile, Uruguay and Russia.

The substance used to combat adult mosquitoes is the insecticide MICROSIN, endorsed by the Ministry of Health, through the National Commission for Biocides, for outdoor use in residential and recreational areas, without adverse effects on the human body and the environment, the Capital City Hall said. In the case of direct contact, it can cause irritation of the airways, which is why the treatments are carried out during the night.Mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus were detected in Bucharest in mid-July, according to data transmitted to the health authorities, but also to the municipality, being requested to take urgent measures mainly in the central area, but also in other green areas. Disinsection, started in Bucharest with more than two months of delayThe mayor of the capital, Nicușor Dan, announced on June 8th that the disinsection and deratization operations in Bucharest had begun, the operation being delayed by more than two months, while many Bucharest residents complained that some parks are full of rats or ticks,  in the uncut grass.
Normally, depending on the weather, the anti-mosquito treatments were started towards the end of March, so there was a delay of over two months and the larval treatments were missed, very important so that we do not wake up when the heat comes with a mosquito invasion. In a response sent to the HotNews.ro by the Capital City Hall, in mid-May, it was specified that the activity will be provided this year by the Municipal Company Eco Sanitization, to which the service was delegated in 2019, until dissolution, and that it will most likely start at the end of May, after the approval in the General Council of the Unitary Action Program 2021,  which determines where it is sprinkled and how many times. The budget allocated for this year is about 38 million lei and concerns both treatments to combat mosquitoes and rats. According to the information communicated HotNews.ro by the municipality, in April, the employees of the Municipal Company Eco Sanitization were in technical unemployment as of 01.02.2021.West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes to humans.

After the fear and challenges that the people of Bucharest have passed because of the rats and cockroaches that roam through the capital, a new alert comes to sound a big alarm bell. Bucharest City Hall announced Thursday evening that it has intensified mosquito control treatments since Wednesday, in areas where the presence of West Nile virus has been reported.
Areas where treatments for the annihilation of virus-carrying mosquitoes have been intensified
As if the lack of rat deratization services in Bucharest was not enough, the Catacuzino Institute confirmed the presence of West Nile virus in Bucharest. According to the press release sent by PMB, the areas where the dangerous insects were identified were Splaiul Inindependenţa, Cismigiu and Izvor and Crângași parks.
The Capital City Hall mentioned that it is in direct connection with the Bucharest DSP, and fortunately, so far, no cases of infection with this virus have been reported.
""The Bucharest City Hall, through the Eco-Sanitization Company, has intensified, since Wednesday, July 21st, the treatments to combat mosquitoes in the areas where the presence of West Nile virus was reported, namely: Splaiul Independenţei, the area between Eroilor and The University, Cismigiu and Izvor parks, Crângaşi district.
PMB keeps in daily contact with the Bucharest Public Health Directorate (DSPMB), and so far no cases of transmission of this virus to the population have been confirmed,"" the Capital City Hall said on Thursday evening, according to News.ro.
PMB announced in the same press release that this company responsible for sanitizing the Capital has brought forward the start of the fifth mosquito control treatment (out of the 14 treatments scheduled for this year), thus acting in all parks and areas of the Capital.
""The campaign is carried out daily, from the outskirts of the capital to the center, to covering all areas of Bucharest. Also, in the coming days, the disinsection action will be carried out, as planned, in all the districts of the capital, on the street alignments, on the green spaces between the blocks, on the green spaces of the institutions subordinated to the PMB (hospitals, cemeteries, etc.), as well as in the district heating networks belonging to the Municipal Company Termoenergetica"", the General City Hall said.
How west nile virus infection is transmitted
According to specialists, infection with this virus is transmitted only through the mosquito bite, and never from human to human. In most cases (80%), infected people do not show symptoms, but there are situations in which febrile states, intense headache, muscle pain, vomiting or rashes occur.
In any of the situations, doctors recommend that you urgently go to the doctor, in order to avoid a possible risk of meningitis. Unfortunately, there are also situations in which mosquitoes carrying the virus bite people over 60, with low immunity or suffering from chronic conditions.
These people may also experience symptoms such as neck stiffness, increased sensitivity to light, convulsions, chills, chronic fatigue and muscle weakness.
The website of the National Center for Communicable Disease Surveillance and Control so far does not mention data on cases of West Nile virus infection this year, with the last report being in 2019.
According to the latest data displayed, between 03.06.2019-27.11.2019, 66 cases of infection with West Nile dangerous virus were registered, of which 18 in Bucharest.

8UQ9W1KG3O,West Nile virus: How the Bergzoo Halle deals with the virus find,"West Nile virus: How the Bergzoo Halle deals with the virus find

No acute danger for visitors: After the West Nile virus, which is also dangerous for humans, was detected in a dead bird at Halle Zoo, both the zoo and the researchers do not assume any particular risk for visitors. Zoo Director Dennis Müller told MDR SACHSEN-ANHALT: ""There are currently no restrictions. Together with the experts, we assess the risk as very low."" It is no larger than usual near stagnant waters.

Since the virus can only be transmitted by mosquitoes such as the Culex mosquito or the tiger mosquito – and one has now had the first cold nights – the risk of infection is to be assessed as very low, Müller continues. ""The mosquito populations are collapsing and the virus also seems to need a high temperature to multiply in the mosquitoes at all – over 20 degrees day and night is mentioned there. We don't have that situation anymore."" The bearded owl was infected two weeks ago, according to the zoo. ""So we are now a long way behind this time and have already had another death in the aviary, where the virus could no longer be detected,"" explains Müller.

Mosquito researcher Doreen Walther also calls for calm. Walther, who conducts research at the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research on the spread of viruses by bloodsucking insects, said in an interview with MDR SACHSEN-ANHALT: ""I am far from trying to stir up panic."" Additional vaccinations are not necessary. It is more important to educate the population and improve precautions. A visit to the zoo is not a problem.

The researcher explained that the case in Halle was the northernmost occurrence of the virus. Since the 1960s, there have been isolated cases, especially in southern Europe. There were also minor epidemics.

If people were infected, there would be ""summer flu-like symptoms"" such as fever. In less than one percent of cases, the central nervous system is attacked. Then the disease could also be fatal. Healthy adults would rather not be affected. The focus is on children and the elderly, because the immune system is not fully developed there.

As a rule, however, horses and passerine birds would be affected. Müller added: ""At the moment, we cannot rule out any mammal species or bird species. Potentially, the virus seems to go in many ways."" Therefore, the zebras of the zoo would now be particularly observed.

According to the zoo, however, there is no reason to panic. The veterinary office had been informed, quarantine had not been imposed, and the zoo remained open – not even partial barriers were necessary. In order to get an idea of the mosquito population, mosquito traps are also set up. The collected insects are then frozen and sent to the Friedrich Löffler Institute.

In addition, the water in all stagnant waters was drained and refilled with fresh water, according to zoo director Dennis Müller, ""in order to greatly reduce the mosquito population."" A measure that will certainly have to be repeated in the coming years. Müller told MDR SACHSEN-ANHALT that the weather was certainly an unfavorable factor for the occurrence. ""For years we have been observing the advance of the tiger mosquito. In Halle, it has been known for some time that it is here."" He suspects that in the future one will have to deal more often with ""the fact that diseases that are more in the subtropical area are occasionally detected in our latitudes.""",https://www.mdr.de/nachrichten/sachsen-anhalt/halle/halle/west-nil-virus-wie-der-bergzoo-halle-mit-dem-virus-umgeht-100.html,EN,DE,2022-05-05 09:53:40,2021-07-31 12:28:47+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),General information (m)

According to researchers' findings, the Borna virus comes from the field shrew, which is widespread in Central Europe. Photo: imago/BlickwinkelNome countries around the world are still suffering from the corona pandemic, the danger has not yet been averted – the next horror report is already coming: In Saxony-Anhalt, the Bornavirus has been detected in a person: The woman in question has already felt symptoms at the end of 2020 and is currently no longer responsive. What kind of virus is this, where does it come from – and is the next pandemic now threatening us?

Again and again, people become infected with the dangerous virusIn recent years, there had been several cases. A 2020 report said that far more people in Germany have been infected with the virus in recent years than expected. The pathogen was detected in Bavaria in stored brain samples of deceased patients, report researchers from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) and the University of Regensburg.  In total, at least 14 people have died since 1995 from the brain inflammation that causes the virus. Read also: West Nile virus: What you need to know >>It was first detected in humans in 2018 – here the virus can cause severe brain inflammation. For a long time, the virus was only known in farm animals, such as sheep and horses. However, the virus has its origin in the field shrew, which is widespread in Central Europe. It is assumed that this excretes the virus via saliva, urine and feces and that animals such as sheep and horses come into contact with it in fields and meadows. So far, it has not been completely clarified how the virus is transmitted to humans. According to reports, it is obvious that it happens through direct contact with infected animals. But this can also happen in other ways – such as free-roaming domestic cats that hunt shrews. According to the Robert Koch Institute, however, human-to-human transmission is unlikely. Symptoms of the disease include headache and fever, but several infections from 2018 and 2019 are particularly dramatic. Among other things, three people had been infected with the deadly disease through organ donation because they had received a kidney or the liver of an infected person from Bavaria. Only one of them survived the disease, but with serious health consequences.Read also: Berlin virologist Drosten: Coronavirus probably comes from China's fur industry >>According to doctors, the symptoms include headaches and fever – but only in the initial stadium.

How do you get infected with Marburg fever – and how dangerous is the disease? We answer all the important questions.The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported an outbreak of Marburg fever in the West African state of Guinea. A man died ten days after the first symptoms appeared – he is considered the first infected person in West Africa. The WHO is now sounding the alarm: The Marburg virus has the potential to ""spread widely"" and must therefore be stopped, said the WHO Regional Director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti in a statement.

More about this in our privacy policy.What is Marburg fever? According to the WHO, Marburg fever is a so-called hemorrhagic fever disease caused by the Marburg virus. Like the Ebola virus, the virus belongs to the group of thread-like filoviruses. Science suspects that the pathogens were originally transmitted from Nile fruit bats to humans. Marburg fever was first detected in 1967 in Marburg, Frankfurt and Belgrade. Laboratory staff had been infected with monkeys imported from Uganda. Marburg is the namesake of the virus, because at that time most infections were detected there. Read more after the adRead more after the adWhere do Marburg viruses occur? The Marburg virus originates from Africa. Since the discovery, outbreaks and individual cases of infection have occurred in Uganda, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya and South Africa, among others, according to the WHO. The latest outbreak was recently announced by the West African state of Guinea. This is the first case ever in West Africa.How do you get infected with Marburg fever? According to the WHO, infection with the Marburg virus is usually preceded by a longer stay in mines or caves populated by Nile fruit bats. If transmission to humans occurs, the virus then spreads primarily through direct human contact. Infections are usually transmitted via body fluids such as blood or body secretions. People can become infected with the Marburg virus via so-called smear infections – for example, if they come into contact with contaminated bed linen or clothing. People remain infectious until their blood is cleared of the virus. Read more after the adRead more after the adHow dangerous is Marburg fever? Marburg fever is highly contagious and, according to the WHO, has an average case mortality rate of 50 percent. The values have varied in past outbreaks between 24 percent and 88 percent. The incubation period is between two and 21 days.The disease leads to high fever. Other initial symptoms include severe headache and muscle pain. On the third day of the disease, nausea, vomiting and severe diarrhea follow, among other things, which can last for days. In the second week after the onset of the disease, those affected usually suffer from internal bleeding and bleed from body openings. Patients who do not survive an infection die on average between eight and nine days after the onset of symptoms as a result of severe blood loss.Are there drugs or vaccines against Marburg fever? Currently, no antiviral drugs or vaccinations against the Marburg virus are approved. However, the WHO emphasizes that the chance of survival can be increased by rehydration – i.e. the oral or intravenous supply of water or aqueous solutions. In addition, the treatment of disease-specific symptoms helps.Read more after the advertisementRead more after the advertisementHow high does the WHO estimate the danger of Marburg fever?

In Europe and Hungary, the delta virus variant of the new coronavirus is already spreading. This mutant, formerly known as Indian, was identified last December and classified as a high risk in March this year. The delta virus mimicry is more contagious, spreads faster and, in addition to the typical symptoms so far, also causes allergy-like symptoms, it can easily appear to be a more severe cold. The virus is the greatest threat to the unvaccinated. The incubation period of the delta virus variant is shorter, on average 4 days, while the alpha virus mimicry averages 6 days. The rate of ""viral excretion"" of infected people is much higher, which causes the delta variant to be 60 percent more contagious and spread faster than the earlier classic virus and its mutations. In the delta variant, loss of taste and smell is relatively rarer than in infection caused by alpha viral mimicry, but rather respiratory, cold-like symptoms are characteristic. Infection most often causes headaches, sore throats, runny noses, sneezes, fever, rise in temperature, drowsiness and lethargy, fever is also a common symptom. Gastrointestinal complaints - nausea, vomiting, diarrhea - can also occur more often. Complaints about hearing - tinnitus, ringing in the ears, dizziness - are also not uncommon.

Contact a specialist who will help you choose the right test. Reliable testing is important for both vaccinated and unvaccinated Vaccination does not clearly guarantee that we cannot infect or transmit the virus. One in four vaccinated patients became infected if they lived in the same household as a confirmed COVID-19 patient, the probability of this being several times higher for the unvaccinated. Therefore, patients with vaccinated and unvaccinated upper respiratory symptoms are important to be tested and tested by asymptomatic persons before they come into direct contact with people in a risky group. The elderly, immunodeficiency and chronically ill remain at risk Antigen and PCR tests are the most reliable in case of suspected coronavirus infection. Testing can thus significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the virus in both unvaccinated and vaccinated people. ""If you have come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus infection, it is definitely worth testing yourself, whether you feel sick, whether you have been vaccinated or not. This is especially important if you live in a household with an unvaccinated person or with a family member who has a severe immune deficit or a risky illness. Transmission of the virus in their case can be fatal. Since we can become infected even with vaccination, it is important that vaccinated people be tested in case of upper respiratory complaints, thus avoiding the transmission of the infection unintentionally. In addition, if someone is found to have had the disease, it is also worth paying attention to the post-COVID symptoms that may occur afterwards,"" said Dr. Orsolya Menyhárt, medical director of outpatient care at Affidea Hungary. The test performed by the specialist Is recommended for the unvaccinated by combined tests, which not only detect the presence of the virus, but also inform the patient about the period of the disease by detecting antibodies. The advantage of the combined test is that it gives a result within 15 minutes. ""For COVID antigen tests, samples are most often taken from the nasal cavity. This is unpleasant and important for practice and experience. During home testing, the patient may not place the sampling stick deep enough or take the smears well enough, so the test will give a false negative result, or it may be unusable in the first place, so it is worthwhile to consult a specialist for the test,"" said Dr. Orsolya Menyhárt.Person and age depend on who has a high level of antibodies after vaccinations.

Many people develop long COVID syndrome, they can have various symptoms for many weeks and months: fatigue, persistent loss of smell or taste, hair loss and numbness. The vast majority of serious complications are related to the cardiovascular system: myocarditis, arrhythmia (arrhythmia) and blood supply disruption to the heart, bacterial pneumonia, accumulation of fluid in the pericardium.

N8OEG3G5M1,Diseases communicable by mosquitoes (also in Slovakia),"Diseases communicable by mosquitoes (also in Slovakia)

Mosquitoes transmit several dozen other diseases. While most of them remain a problem for the tropics, climate change has caused several serious diseases to be transmitted by mosquitoes even in our latitudes. The most numerous group of infections transmitted by mosquitoes are viral diseases caused by representatives from the Arbovirus family. The name is derived from the English arthropod – borne viruses (viruses born in arthropods), which describes precisely the way they spread with the help of arthropods, where we also include mosquitoes (Culicidae). Almost 500 species of arboviruses are described, about 100 of which cause human diseases. These are mainly representatives of the genera Alfavirus, Flavivirus and Bunyavirus, which are transmitted precisely by mosquitoes. The second serious group is parasitic diseases, which include, in addition to malaria, especially dirofilariosis, the occurrence of which has already been recorded in Slovakia in recent years.

Natural foci of infectionsNot all types of mosquitoes are able to transmit the listed infections. Usually this ability is specific, that is, a certain type of mosquito transmits only some infections, or none at all. Therefore, the occurrence of a given disease is closely tied to the presence of a particular type of mosquito in a given territory. If the causative agent of infection is also introduced into such a territory, the latter is able to maintain itself in the mosquito population even by transmission to offspring through eggs (transovarian). In this case, we are talking about a natural outbreak of the disease. Such outbreaks may not appear active at all in a certain period (even several years), but in the case of favorable conditions (heavy rains, floods), there is a strong multiplication of mosquitoes and activation of the outbreak.
The incidence of viral infections transmitted by mosquitoes is relatively little documented. The cause is the system of diagnosis of flu-like diseases. In order to determine their causative agent accurately, sampling and laboratory testing are necessary, which is generally not the case. As a rule, these diseases are dealt with by attenuating symptoms (symptomatic therapy) and are registered as flu-like respiratory diseases. Of course, in indicated cases, such as the currently ongoing epidemic, diagnostics are carried out, but it is aimed only at confirming or ruling out the causative agent of this epidemic. 
------- fever
------- fever ideally documents the state of Czech-Slovak scientific cooperation. A significant part of the study of the causative agent of this disease is the Czech expert RNDr. --------------, DrSc. from the Institute of Vertebrate Biology of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, who carried out his research activities in the wine-famous region of Valtice in southern Moravia, hence the name of the disease. On the other hand, it should be mentioned that the originator was first isolated by Bárdoš and Danielová in 1958 near the village of Ťahyňa in eastern Slovakia (part of Pavloviec nad Uhom in the district of ----------). It was the first mosquito-borne virus isolated in Central Europe and was named after the place of its capture – the ------ virus. The reservoir of the virus can be hares, hedgehogs, rodents or bats. The disease in adults usually passes without symptoms, but in children it often manifests itself with similar symptoms to the flu. It occurs mainly in summer and early autumn. Characteristic is the sudden onset of fever, pain in the muscles, head, joints, laryngitis, nausea, inflammation of the bronchi and lungs, inflammation of the brain and involvement of the central nervous system. Mortality has not yet been recorded (1). Since 1963, about 200 cases have been documented in Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In 1976, this virus was the cause of 15% of cases of summer diseases of children in the Czech Republic (2).

Sindbis feverThe causative agent of the disease was first isolated in 1955 in the Egyptian village of Sindbis. In Europe, it was first detected in Slovakia near Malacca (1). The main hosts in nature are birds. The virus induces a disease in humans, manifested by 3-4 day fever, headaches, musculoskeletal system and mild jaundice (7). Sometimes there are also rashes on the chest and limbs. The acute phase lasts up to 10 days, but fatigue and tendon pain can persist for several months, with chronic joint inflammation developing (1). In 1981, hundreds of cases were recorded in Scandinavia. West Nile Virus, the causative agent of the so-called West Nile Virus, is widespread in the world. In Europe, it has been proven in southern Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Romania, France, Spain, Portugal, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic (1). The most dangerous vector of this virus is the mosquito species Culex pipiens biotype molestus, which lives synanthropically (close to humans) and is often the cause of outbreaks in cities (3). For example, the 1999 outbreak of infection in New York is known, which claimed 7 victims (4).

PZHJYSCFIE,Covid-19. High risk of spreading the virus in flood-stricken areas of Europe,"Covid-19. High risk of spreading the virus in flood-stricken areas of Europe

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) today estimated a ""high"" risk for increased spread of SARS-CoV-2, which causes covid-19, in flood-affected areas of Europe such as Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. In a risk assessment report released today on the ""catastrophic floods"" of mid-July in central Europe that caused the deaths of some 200 people, ECDC analyses the ""most common infectious diseases and health risks associated with flood-affected areas."" With regard to covid-19, ""and considering the increasing prevalence of the Delta variant of concern and the fact that substantial proportions of the population are not vaccinated, the likelihood of increasing the circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in flood-affected areas is high,"" the European agency estimates in the document. Other factors which, according to the ECDC, may contribute to the increased risk of covid-19 in these areas, but also in the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area as a whole, include the ""potential disruption of testing and screening programmes and the difficulties of implementing isolation and quarantine measures"". In addition, ""the impacts on anticovid-19 vaccination and obstacles to the maintenance of restrictive measures in the community or in multi-family homes increase this risk,"" the agency adds. The overall death toll in the weather that battered Central Europe in mid-July amounts to 200, according to the most recent data from July 20. The floods caused electricity cuts in several areas and caused damage to the communication networks, notably knocked down telecommunications antennas, which will have prevented people from receiving the alerts in due course. The ECDC further points out that ""rapid responses implemented in affected countries - such as access to health care, drinking water and rescue shelters - have substantially mitigated the risk of infectious diseases in affected populations, as well as the subsequent spread to other areas of the EU and EEA."" Also in relation to covid-19, the European agency insists on a high risk of spreading the virus, reminding ""community members living in close contact with displaced persons or between groups of displaced or withdrawn people due to overcrowding and the potential challenges of maintaining restrictive measures"". ""Although the risk of severe covid-19 is low in fully vaccinated individuals, strict restrictive measures are encouraged in all affected areas to prevent infection among partially vaccinated or unvaccinated individuals,"" ECDC suggests. At issue are measures such as hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing and use of facial masks, precise. Also advised by the European Centre is the continuation of anticovid-19 vaccination, which should ""remain a priority"", and therefore ""disturbances in the delivery of vaccines in flood-affected areas"" should be overcome. ""Testing and contact tracking should also remain a priority,"" he said. In this assessment of risks of infectious diseases, ECDC speaks of very low or low risks of infections such as influenza, tetanus, measles, chickenpox, hepatitis A, legionella and West Nile virus, as well as other mosquito-borne diseases. In the intermediate to high risk category are SARS-CoV-2, escherichia coli, salmonella, cryptosporidium and norovirus infections. Another highlight of the European centre is legionella, advising the body of local authorities to implement ""risk-minimising water management plans"".",https://expresso.pt/coronavirus/2021-07-29-Covid-19.-Risco-elevado-de-propagacao-do-virus-em-zonas-da-Europa-atingidas-por-cheias-51efdbc9,EN,PT,2022-05-11 07:34:04,2021-07-29 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),
WDUDNYHJ28,Marburg virus,"Marburg virus

The Marburg virus belongs to the same family as the Ebola virus and causes a type of hemorrhagic fever known as Marburg fever or Marburg virus disease. The disease is serious, can cause death and, so far, there are no treatments or vaccines for the problem. Outbreaks of this disease occur in Africa from time to time. The lethality rate is between 23% and 90%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

 Topics in this articleSummary of the Marburg virus

The Marburg virus is from the same family as Ebola, being responsible for causing a type of hemorrhagic fever.

It is a zoonotic virus, that is, transmitted to man through other animals. African frugivorous bats are believed to be the natural reservoirs of this virus.

The virus can be transmitted from one person to another through direct contact with body fluids or with contaminated objects.

Marburg virus disease can cause symptoms such as headache, fever, muscle alevel and bleeding.

There are no vaccines or treatments available so far for this disease.
Don't stop now... There's more after the publicity ;)

What is the Marburg virus?
The Marburg virus is the etiological agent of the so-called Marburg fever or Marburg virus disease, a rare and very severe type of hemorrhagic fever. He is part of the same family as the Ebola virus, the Filoviridae family. This virus is zoonotic, that is, transmitted to man through other animals. The bat of the species Rousettus aegyptiacus is believed to be the natural reservoir of this virus.
Brief history of Marburg virus disease 
Marburg virus disease was recognised after a simultaneous severe outbreak in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany, and Belgrade, Serbia, in 1967. In all, 32 people were infected, who presented symptoms of fever and internal bleeding. The first people infected were laboratory employees and later their families and doctors. The officials were contaminated during autopsies on monkeys imported from Uganda. These professionals were involved in the production of polio vaccines.
After a series of studies, it was found that the outbreak of hemorrhagic fever observed in the three regions was a consequence of infection by a previously unknown virus. He was called marburg virus, because the largest number of cases was recorded in this city.
After the identification and description of the disease, other cases were recorded after a few years. The first epidemic of the disease occurred in 1999 and 2000 in the Democratic Republic of congo. At the time, the mortality of Marburg virus disease reached more than 70%. The cases that occurred after the discovery in 1967 had in common the fact that the infected were in cave regions or in places with large bat populations.

Marburg virus transmission
The transmission of the Marburg virus begins through human contact with an infected animal. African frugivorous bats are considered natural reservoirs of the virus, so they are considered sources of infection. Studies seek to determine whether other vertebrate species can also host the virus.
After initial contamination, marburg virus can be transmitted from one person to another, and the infection is the result of direct contact with blood or other body fluids, such as saliva, secretions from the airways, urine, vomiting, feces, and semen. In addition to direct contact with fluids of the sick patient, an individual may become infected by coming into contact with surfaces and objects contaminated by these fluids. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), transmission through contaminated injection equipment or needle stick injuries is associated with more serious diseases.
Many people become infected with the virus while caring for a sick patient, and this contamination can occur at home or even in a hospital environment. In addition, certain funeral practices contribute to the transmission of the virus in certain communities.
Symptoms of Marburg virus disease 
Symptoms of Marburg virus disease begin after an incubation period, which lasts between 2 to 21 days. Symptoms arise suddenly and include fever, headache, chills, muscle ado, and severe malaise.
With the advance of the disease, other symptoms arise, such as rashes, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, chest pain and sore throat. Feces and vomiting may have fresh blood. In addition, the patient may present with blood loss through the gums, nose and vagina.
Marburg virus disease can also trigger inflammation of the pancreas, delirium, confusion, irritability, weight loss, jaundice, liver failure, m",https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/doencas/virus-de-marburg.htm,EN,PT,2022-05-06 11:21:19,2021-08-16 13:51:22+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

NG9GE2NKF9,Why it is impossible to get rid of the Korean mosquito,"Why it is impossible to get rid of the Korean mosquito

To keep bench, in these days, is the news of the Korean mosquito landed in Lombardy but which, in reality, already populated many regions of Northern Italy for some years as we have recently dealt with the Giornale.it. Since the research is deepening, new elements emerge to know our new ""enemy"" even in winter. Here's how it spreadThe Aedes koreicus, a relative of the tiger mosquito (also imported from tropical countries), in addition to resisting low temperatures (up to -13), is part of those called ""container breeding mosquitoes"". These mosquitoes are characterized by producing eggs that can be deposited in small containers and resistant to drying, so they are able to be transported even for long distances and over a fairly long period of time thanks to their method of ""preservation"": this is how they got to us. ""This feature makes them able to occupy new environments and be passively transported,"" parasitologist Marco Pombi told Repubblica. If in Italy we also find it in Liguria and Trentino, in Europan Slovenia, Germany and Hungary has also spread.How transport takes placeIf it is true that air transport is also decisive for the spread of these insects in places thousands of kilometers away from their natural habitats, there is also another way in which the spread takes place. ""The transport takes place through used tires, it could be one of the ways in which it came to us"", underlines the expert. Because it will not be possible to eliminateThe bad news is that we will have to live with it, as has always been the case for the summer ones. ""The possibility that it can be eliminated is almost nil as it has been for other invasive species. By now we can consider it endemic at least for Northern Italy"". It will not be easy to predict its movements because it is linked to hilly contexts and has an ecology a bit complementary to that of the tiger mosquito that is ""holed up"" more in the heavily urbanized flat areas. But what are the favorable ecological conditions for the new Korean mosquito? The cold, above all, since unlike her colleagues she resists snow and sub-zero temperatures. How much and where it can be expanded, however, is still taken to say. The health risksDoc. Piombi explains that one of the characteristics of Aedes koreicus is the transmission of the Japanese encephalitis virus in addition to some studies that link it to vector competence, that is, to the ability of this mosquito to transmit other pathogens such as the chikungunya virus, as the tiger mosquito has done in the past years (epidemics of 2007 and 2017). It is still too early to say that he will behave exactly like his relative but the risk is there. ""We cannot rule out the hypothesis that it may have a role in maintaining, for example, any transmission zones,"" concludes the expert. Problems also for animals? The risks, however, are not only related to man. ""We don't know if he also stings animals or what his preference is,"" Paolo Gabrieli, a zoologist, one of the researchers at the Department of Biosciences at the State University of Milan, told Adnkronos. A not insignificant detail to understand its ability to transmit viruses or pathogens. ""Not knowing this is a problem because animals carry pathogens and this carries great risks. Just think of the Nile Fever virus, which circulates in migratory birds and passes to humans through mosquito bites"". At the moment, as mentioned, its privileged environment seems to be the mountain: researchers have found larvae of this mosquito along the entire Alpine arc in addition to the area of Bergamo and Brescia. ""We have no idea what the potential risk of its presence is. It can be - he reiterates - harmless or it can be risky. For now we know, for example, that it is capable of transmitting the filaria, known to hit dogs. This already poses a veterinary problem.""",https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/perch-impossibile-eliminare-zanzara-coreana-1983651.html,EN,IT,2022-06-03 16:21:55,2021-10-21 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

All District Directorates are in heightened epizootic readiness due to bird flu
The responsibility for our control is enormous, it must be carried out in the best way, says Dr. Hristo Valchanov in a special interview with STANDARD newspaper

Dr. Hristo Valchanov is a graduate veterinarian from the Thracian University of Stara Zagora. He specializes in veterinary health expertise of food products at the Central Research Veterinary Medical Institute - Sofia. He has completed a number of additional courses for the development, implementation and auditing of HACCP (Food Safety Control System) in Bulgaria and Italy. Dr. Valchanov started his activities in the competent authority as an inspector. In 2012-2013 he headed the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (Bulgarian Academy of Food Safety).

The management of the Bulgarian Academy of Staff is a difficult task, nor for a moment has the Agency interrupted the performance of its duties 

- Dr. Valchanov, in his interview the Minister of Agriculture Prof. Dr. Dr.Sc.(Econ.) Hristo Bozukov said that an audit is currently underway at the Bulgarian Academy of Experts, according to which many of the agency's duties have been outsourced, given that the Bulgarian Academy of Experts could also carry them out. What in particular are we talking about?
- The results of the audit showed what we knew in general terms, namely - some functions of the competent authority are carried out by external companies, through contract award. It is no surprise to us that the Bulgarian Academy of Human Arrivals is not ready to immediately take over the implementation of these activities. The reasons are rooted mainly, but not exclusively, in the financing of these functions, but I can say that to date, very actively work is being carried out so that they are implemented by the Agency.
- You were appointed CEO of the Bulgarian Academy of Police in July this year. What has changed in the agency's work?
- The management of the Bulgarian Academy of Animals is a difficult task, if you will only because it is the competent authority in the three main areas that control food safety – food production and trade, animal health entering the agri-food chain, as well as in the plant protection sector. We're all consumers of food on the market. The responsibility for our control is immense, accordingly, it must be carried out in the best way, with optimal frequency and mandatory according to the legislation.Currently, in addition to its official control obligations, since March last year the Agency has also overseen compliance with some of the measures ordered by the Health Ministry to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.  for example, we see all of the situation in Europe with regard to animal diseases. According to data from the European Commission (EK) as of 21.11.2021, the virus of Highly Pathogenic Influenza (H5) has been confirmed in over 1 988 wild birds and in 1 315 outbreaks on poultry farms. The strains that spread are mainly H5N8 and H5N1. In this indomibable epizootic situation with regard to the disease in Bulgaria since the beginning of the year, 10 outbreaks have been recorded so far, of which only two are in the last month, from the H5N1 strain, which is not characteristic of our country.  All Regional Directorates for Food Safety (ODBS) have been brought into a state of increased epizootic readiness. I have requested from the OODBH to conduct information campaigns for poultry owners, hunters, through and/or jointly with representatives of the local authority, hunting farms on state forest and hunting farms, registered veterinarians with a focus - compliance with biosecurity measures, keeping birds indoors, immediate notification to the veterinarian or mayor in case of deviation in the health of the kept birds or in case of increased mortality.  detection of virus circulation in nature, supervision in wild birds is of utmost importance. In this regard, we rely on cooperation from ornithological companies, national hunting associations, state forest enterprises and regional forestry directorates to notify the presence of sick or dead wild birds and send samples thereof for examination to the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza (A) and Newcastle Disease of birds at the National Wildlife Refuge, Sofia.  The mobile application of the Bulgarian Academy of Science - ""Module Love"" has undergone modifications, already fully functional and can be used for the supervision of wild birds, for avian influenza, Newcastle disease (pseudo-bird) in the birds and West Nil fever.

0VDSMO3KPZ,The mosquito in your bedroom comes from your own garden. Will it soon spread the West Nile virus?,"The mosquito in your bedroom comes from your own garden. Will it soon spread the West Nile virus?

With a scoop net, mosquito expert at the RIVM Marieta Braks quickly catches a few mosquitoes that fly around above the dirty water of a sewerage well that she has just opened. Dark, stagnant water as in the overflow of this sidewalk vortex is an ideal breeding ground for the common house mosquito Culex pipiens. When Braks scoops some water from the well a little later with a container on a stem, her premonition turns out to be correct. Against the white plastic of the tray, the silhouettes of all life stages of this ordinary Dutch mosquito are clearly visible: from the black egg packets, ""in each package there are 150 eggs"", says Braks, to the four consecutive larval stages of the insect. But also some pupae and two adult mosquitoes that have just crawled out of the pupa float in the small bowl of water. ""Look, this one still has the brown membrane of the doll hanging from its abdomen,"" Braks points out. The interest in the ordinary Dutch mosquito is suddenly life-size, because it is the main transmitter of the West Nile virus to humans. This virus mainly infects birds, but can also reach humans via the mosquito. Usually the infection goes unnoticed, but sometimes it causes meningitis that in exceptional cases can be fatal. Until recently, the West Nile virus only occurred in warmer regions in Europe, but last year it appeared for the first time in the Netherlands. The virus was found during a virus spread study among birds at a warbler near Utrecht.

The fear was that the Netherlands could just get a new infectious disease – at a time when the pandemic coronavirus was already causing victims. But this year, no West Nile virus has been found in Dutch birds or mosquitoes. It's too early to conclude that it won't show up this year. One hundred times as many infectionsIn 2020, West Nile fever was detected in eight Dutch people, who probably all contracted it locally. Experts assume that in reality there must have been a hundred times as many infections in the Netherlands, without clear symptoms. Despite that, the chance of getting infected in the Netherlands is minimal – and certainly the chance of getting sick. So why so much attention for such a not very threatening new infectious disease? This is due to the fact that the West Nile virus potentially finds a spread bed here. The virus is new and still rare, but with the millions of house mosquitoes as potential spreaders, that can change quickly. And those mosquitoes are close to us."" Mosquitoes do not fly very far. The females get their blood meal close by,"" says Braks. ""So the mosquitoes that fly in at night and keep you from sleeping with their buzzing come in nine out of ten cases from your own garden or from that of the neighbors.""
The solution is simple: empty these types of pots regularly
************* mosquito expert
This also means that people can do something about mosquito nuisance and the associated risk of contracting West Nile fever, says Braks. She previously worked as a researcher for the government in the US state of California, where the West Nile virus spread by birds and mosquitoes did indeed gain a foothold. ""There they made the population aware of the risk of disease transmission by mosquitoes by means of a trick with many D's. Dusk and dawn, DEET, dress and drain. The latter refers to the disposal of excess water."" A muddy drabAt a thirty-year-old house in Utrecht, Braks looks over a hedge in the front yard. Look: there is a plastic pot with rainwater. She empties the jar into the tray she brought with her. A muddy drab of half-digested leaves. She throws in some clean water from a field bottle. Then we indeed see the mosquito larvae swarming again, fleeing from the people who have disturbed their peace. Stagnant scraps of rainwater in saucers, plant pots or gutters quickly become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. In these temporary and shallow places there are no fish, salamanders or frogs that the mosquito larvae like to eat, so they have the realm alone. The fact that the water is dirty and oxygen-free does not bother the larvae. They hang upside down on the surface of the water and can breathe in the air with a siphon (a kind of snorkel) on their abdomen. If the water remains for two weeks, you have a new generation of mosquitoes. ""The solution is simple,"" says Braks, ""empty these types of pots regularly. Or even better: turn them upside down, so that no water remains in them."" Climate change is often cited as an explanation for the emergence of West Nile virus in the Netherlands. The reasoning behind it is that the virus spreads faster at higher temperatures ",https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/09/02/de-mug-in-je-slaapkamer-komt-uit-je-eigen-tuin-verspreidt-die-straks-het-westnijlvirus-a4056862,EN,NL,2022-08-24 15:45:51,2021-09-02 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),General information (m)
1XGD5Z5NUW,Five more west nile virus infections in the Utrecht region,"Five more west nile virus infections in the Utrecht region

NOS Nieuws•Sunday 8 November 2020, 13:03No more infections with West Nile virus in the Utrecht regionIn the Utrecht region, another five people have been infected with the West Nile virus. This is evident from figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). In mid-October it became known that a first infection had been detected in the Netherlands, in a man who probably had also contracted it near Utrecht. The virus occurs in birds and can be transmitted to humans through mosquitoes, especially in the summer. It is not transmitted from person to person. Most people who contract the virus (80 percent) don't get sick, and most others have only mild symptoms such as fever or flu symptoms. Just vulnerable, often older people can contract brain inflammation. WarblerThe new infections have been brought out by the Platform Stop Invasive Exotics. That believes that rivm should actively disclose the infections. The institute itself does not think this is necessary; in the first case, this was reported. The West Nile virus in Europe is mainly found in southern countries. It is also relatively common in the east of Germany. Until the beginning of this month, more than 300 infections in humans were known in Europe. In August, the virus was found for the first time in the Netherlands, near a warbler in a nature reserve near Haarzuilens.",https://nos.nl/l/2355696,EN,NL,2022-09-30 12:00:01,2020-11-08 07:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),Outbreak declaration (m)
273CN73GLG,First west nile virus infection contracted in the Netherlands,"First infection with West Nile virus contracted in the Netherlands • 15-10-2020 • reading time 2 minutes • 87 views • storage© PixabayAfter birds and mosquitoes were found with west nile virus in Utrecht in August and September, the first infection has been detected in a human being. A man probably contracted the virus because he was bitten by a mosquito near Utrecht. It is the first time that someone contracts the virus in the Netherlands, reports the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). The man suffered from fever, muscle aches and headaches. These are symptoms of west nile virus and that is why it was decided to test him. Spread by mosquitoesThe disease is spread by infected mosquitoes, including the tiger mosquito. The West Nile virus occurs in birds that hardly get sick from it. For example, a warbler at Haarzuilens had the virus among the members. Later it turned out that two other birds had also become infected. Only crows appear to get sick from it. In the event of sudden mass death of these birds, the West Nile virus must immediately be thought of. People and horsesWhen people get infected, they usually don't get sick. About 80 percent get no symptoms at all, 20 percent get mild symptoms such as fever and flu-like complaints. In exceptional cases, an infection can lead to serious neurological complaints, such as brain inflammation. A small proportion of patients may die. Horses also appear to be susceptible to infection and die from it earlier. Humans and horses cannot transmit the virus to other humans or to animals. Even if a mosquito stings a human or horse with the disease among its members, it cannot absorb enough virus to then spread it again. West Nile virus in EuropeIn southeastern Europe and around the Mediterranean, the virus has already spread further due to the early and prolonged high temperatures with some rain showers. For the mosquitoes, these are favorable conditions for reproduction. In 2018, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control stated that it was surprised by the rapid spread of the disease, which they mainly blamed on climate change and the increase in international contacts. That is why RIVM already took into account that someone in the Netherlands would become infected. RIVM thinks that the chance of a new case is small in the coming period because of the autumn and winter weather. When the 'mosquito season' starts next year, RIVM will come up with ""advice and any further actions"".

429CW3TOAS,West Nile virus is also gaining a foothold in the Netherlands,"West Nile virus is also gaining a foothold in the Netherlands

In a few months' time, at least seven people have already become infected.
Originally, West Nile virus only occurred in Africa. But in recent decades, it has spread quite rapidly around the world and has also advanced towards Central Europe. It therefore seemed a matter of time before the virus would reach the Netherlands. And now the time has come. After an infection was detected in our country for the first time in October, six more infections followed this month. And with that, the virus now also seems to have gained a foothold in the Netherlands.
About the West Nile virusThe virus occurs among birds, but is spread by house mosquitoes: the most common mosquito species in the Netherlands. The mosquitoes pick up the virus when they sting infected birds. Once infected, such a mosquito can spread the virus to other birds, but also to humans and other mammals, such as horses (which can become very ill from the virus). Once infected, animals or humans cannot transmit the virus to others. Most people (about 80 percent) do not notice an infection, but 10 to 20 percent get mild symptoms such as fever or flu-like symptoms. In addition, there is a very small chance – about 1 percent – that infected people will develop a serious neurological disease, such as brain inflammation. The virus thus poses a particular risk to elderly people and people with reduced resistance. In the US (where the virus was first detected in 1999, after which it spread rapidly across the continent), the virus claims between 100 and 200 lives annually. 
The West Nile virus was first detected in a Dutch man in October. It was assumed that he contracted the virus because he had been stung by a mosquito in Utrecht. Recent research by scientists at Wageningen University confirms this. The scientists found mosquitoes carrying west nile virus in the same environment where the man would have been bitten. And in the summer, a warbler was also caught in the same area that had the West Nile virus with it. It can now be established with certainty that the virus can be found in the Netherlands and is already transmitted by mosquitoes to both humans and animals. 
In line with expectations
This is not very surprising, says entomologist ----------------, affiliated with Wageningen University (WUR). ""It was in line with expectations when we look at the countries around us. There, too, there were more and more frequent and increasingly northern reports of positive birds, mosquitoes, horses or people."" Although it has now been proven that the West Nile virus also occurs in the Netherlands, it remains unclear to what extent it has spread – unnoticed – in our country. ""For example, it is still difficult to say how large the actual number of infected mosquitoes is among the entire population,"" koenraadt says. ""Often it's only tenths of a percent.""
Climate changeThe fact that the West Nile virus is spreading further and further around the world and now also occurs in more northern areas – such as the Netherlands – can probably also be traced back to climate change, says ---------, who has been researching the West Nile virus and other viruses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, such as the Zika and chikungunya virus, in his laboratory for almost ten years. ""Climate change certainly has an impact on the transmission of viruses by mosquitoes. Because mosquitoes are cold-blooded animals, their development is highly dependent on temperature. The warmer it is in general, the faster it goes. And if that goes faster, you can also get larger populations of mosquitoes in a shorter time, and that results in a greater risk of disease transmission. In addition, the development of the virus in the mosquito is also highly dependent on temperature: the warmer it is, the faster the virus can multiply from the mosquito's stomach and eventually find its way to the salivary glands.""
Origin
So the virus is in the Netherlands. But it remains unclear exactly how it ended up here. ""That remains speculative. But based on the genetic code of the virus, we can of course say something about its origin. If you make a kind of family tree of previously sequenced viruses and the virus that was found in the Netherlands, you can trace this back."" Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Center have created such a family tree and have to conclude that the virus found in the Netherlands is very similar to the virus we know from Germany (where it first appeared in 2018) and Austria. ""The exact route is unclear, but it is probably (migratory) birds that spread it over a longer distance. The flight range of a mosquito is many times smaller (several hundred meters to a maximum of several kilometers),",https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2NpZW50aWFzLm5sL3dlc3RuaWpsdmlydXMta3Jpamd0LW9vay1pbi1uZWRlcmxhbmQtdmFzdGUtdm9ldC1hYW4tZGUtZ3JvbmQv0gEA?oc%3D5,EN,NL,2022-10-23 00:29:56,2020-11-12 07:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),Consequences (m)
57RBE0YDHV,Heat wave causes more insect pests in Spain,"Heat wave causes more insect pests in Spain

This article is 8 months old and can therefore no longer be current.
MADRID – The heat wave with the associated extremely high temperatures in various parts of Spain has caused more insect pests than in other years. According to the experts, there are more tickling mosquitoes, ticks, tiger mosquitoes and common mosquitoes than usual and that is very annoying, sickening and even deadly. In the vicinity of Seville, for the second consecutive year, mosquitoes that spread the West Nile virus are also affected.
Experts from the Asociación Nacional de Empresas de Sanidad Ambiental (ANECPLA) indicate that there are more tickling mosquitoes (moscas negras), ticks (garrapatas), tiger mosquitoes (mosquitoes tigre) and common mosquitoes (mosquitoes) than usual. The reason for this is probably the recent heat wave with extremely high temperatures that allow the insects to live better and reproduce.
Below we report a short explanation of the most common and annoying insect pests that are now registered in various places in Spain.
Mosquitoes (mosquitoes and mosquitoes tigres)
In Spain you have the common buzzing mosquito and the annoying silent but much more painful tiger mosquito. In themselves, these insects are not deadly or bad for health (although the tiger mosquito can carry viruses) but sitting outside on a terrace during the barbecue or reading a book under the moonlight can be seriously ruined by mosquitoes.
Tiger mosquitoes live mainly during the day and even sting through the pants where some people can suffer from a tiger mosquito bite. The common mosquitoes often appear in the evening and in addition to the fact that you can get a lot of itching, the buzz in your ear is enough not to be able to close an eye.
Another mosquito species that causes a lot of problems and even causes deaths near Seville is the 'culex perexiguus' that can transmit the West Nile virus (virus del Nilo Occidental) to humans. In 2020, this mosquito accounted for 77 cases of infection of which some people died and this year there are again some cases of infection and even one death known. 
Itchy mosquito (mosca negra)
The tickling mosquito or the 'simuliidae' is a type of mosquito that can cause quite a bit of pain and even death for birds and mice. The tickling mosquito can be compared to the tiger mosquito as it also attacks during the day and can easily pierce through clothing. They are small, black or orange-red to gray insects with short legs and antennae. They are recognizable by their small wings. The body length varies from 1 to 5 mm.
The males feed mainly on nectar, but the females suck blood from humans and animals, among other things. From such a bite one can get painful itching and swelling for days. If the tickling mosquito bites, the animal removes a piece of skin after which the mosquito can suck blood more easily without initially being aware of it. However, it is the saliva of the tickling mosquito that can cause a reaction such as a large red bump that can swell in some people and become redder. Visiting a doctor is then the best thing one can do.
Ticks (garrapatas)
Ticks, just like in other countries, also occur in Spain and partly because of the warm weather and other climatic conditions, ticks sometimes have free play. In addition to the normal ticks that can bite both humans and animals, there are also the so-called giant ticks.
The hyalommateek or giant tick (Hyalomma) is mainly found in southern and eastern Europe, including large parts of Spain. The hyalommateek is considered the main carrier of viral hemorrhagic fever (Crimean Congo fever). The Crimean Congo fever virus is considered an emerging pathogen in Europe.
But despite the fact that the ticks can be deadly, these bugs must first have been in contact with a sick animal to transmit the virus. According to experts, that chance is currently small in Spain but not entirely impossible.
The best known diseases that are transmitted by the tick are Typhoid fever and Lyme disease. Lyme disease only appears years later, and can lead to a wide range of complaints. The most common symptoms are chronic fatigue, muscle pain, headaches, transient temperature changes of several hours and flu-like symptoms. When you have a tick bite, it is therefore important to remove the parasite as soon as possible.",https://www.spanjevandaag.com/23/08/2021/hittegolf-zorgt-voor-meer-insectenplagen-in-spanje/,EN,NL,2022-04-05 20:57:18,2021-08-23 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),Consequences (m)

CIS0E9Z3PB,West Nile virus found in three people in Germany,"West Nile virus found in three people in Germany

In the east of Germany, three people have been diagnosed with west nile virus. This is reported by researchers from the virology institute of the Charité University Medical Center in Berlin. Two of the infections were found in the blood of blood donors from Berlin and Brandenburg in August during a standard check for these types of viral infections. The third infection was also detected in August in a patient who had been admitted to a Berlin hospital with meningitis.

Read a report about Dutch mosquitoes: The mosquito in your bedroom comes from your own garden. Will it soon spread the West Nile virus?

West Nile virus circulates among wild birds and is transmitted by mosquitoes. Occasionally, people with this virus also become infected if they are pricked by an infected mosquito. Most people do not notice this infection, but in one in five it manifests itself in flu-like symptoms. In very rare cases, West Nile fever can result in meningitis and people can die from it. Hibernating virusThe West Nile virus, which originates from Africa, occurs in increasingly northern regions. Last year it was seen for the first time in the Netherlands, in the Utrecht region. The virus was then found in birds, mosquitoes and in eight people who probably contracted it in their own country. Previous cases of West Nile fever in the Netherlands were all infections that people had contracted abroad. In Germany, the West Nile virus has probably been able to hibernate in the mosquitoes, becoming an endemic infectious disease. The German virologists conclude this because the viruses of the three patients were genetically very similar to viruses that were detected in humans and birds in eastern Germany in previous years. Whether the West Nile virus has also survived the winter in the Netherlands is not yet clear. This year, West Nile virus has not yet been seen here, while researchers regularly check birds and mosquitoes for West Nile virus. However, the season is not over yet. The first report of a West Nile patient came last year only in October.",https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2021/09/02/westnijlvirus-aangetroffen-bij-drie-mensen-in-duitsland-a4056860,EN,NL,2022-04-18 17:36:56,2021-09-02 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

Also in the Netherlands, the normal brown house mosquito can transmit tropical diseases; last year, seven people in the Utrecht and Arnhem region contracted the West Nile virus. And the risk of outbreaks of tropical infectious diseases - such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika - is also increasing in the Netherlands due to climate change. Preparing for exotic mosquito
The researchers are now mapping the normal ""house, garden and kitchen mosquito"", says program manager Maarten Hoek in the NOS Radio 1 News. ""But if the climate has changed so much and an exotic mosquito is located here, we can better combat it.""
The app is important to determine where the mosquito research should be carried out. ""Don't hit too hard, because then we won't be able to recognize him anymore,"" says Hoek. ""And of course we can't tell from the hump which mosquito it was, but it does give an indication of the nuisance.""
Success in Spain
In Spain, the app has already proven its usefulness; Spaniards sent in more than 18,000 photos in a short time, accurately mapping the distribution of the Asian tiger mosquito. That originally Southeast Asian mosquito can transmit diseases such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika.
To better prepare the Netherlands for the arrival of disease-causing insects, 10 million euros became available in 2019.

This is reported by the foundation platform Stop invasive exotics, which keeps track of mosquito figures. Tiger mosquitoes have been discovered in five municipalities. This happened in Amstelveen, Assen, Lelystad, Moerdijk and Sittard.De foundation relies on data from the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA). The tiger mosquito and the yellow fever mosquito are animals that do not originally occur in the Netherlands. They can spread various viral diseases in humans and animals, such as dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile virus and various forms of brain inflammation. The bugs probably come along with imported car tires and bamboo plants. Supervisory authority NVWA states on the website where and when the exotic mosquitoes were found. How many mosquitoes have been made per find will be announced at the end of the year. Last year, tiger mosquitoes and yellow fever mosquitoes were found in two municipalities. It was then about 585 tiger mosquitoes and 34 yellow fever mosquitoes. The tiger mosquito is a lot smaller than an ordinary mosquito and has black with white stripes. The yellow fever mosquito, which stings mainly during the day, is 3 to 4 millimeters in size.

Staatsbosbeheer extra alert to signs of bird flu in nature reserves

28 October 2021, 06:00 • 4 minutes reading time
 Bird rings in the floodplains at Zwartsluis Nature managers in Overijssel are extra alert to signals that indicate the presence of the bird flu virus in nature reserves. In particular, dead waterfowl, including geese, ducks and swans, should be reported and removed as soon as possible. The dangerous variant of the bird flu virus - which turned up at a poultry farm in Zeewolde on Tuesday - and caused a nationwide cage obligation, has almost certainly been transmitted by migratory birds that hibernate in our country. Therefore, the nature managers must report suspicious situations as soon as possible, clean up the dead animals and offer them for further investigation. ""It is mainly the water birds, geese, swans and ducks from the north and east of Europe that bring the bird virus here,"" says Jeroen Bredenbeek, forester at Staatsbosbeheer in the Kop van Overijssel. ""They come to our country in the migration season, from mid-October to February. That's because they can't find much food in northern and eastern Europe, and also Asia, during the winter period."" Bredenbeek tells his story, while he is busy ringing a large number of migratory birds in the floodplains of Zwartsluis. He catches the animals to ring them for the national migratory bird research.
 Rings of migratory birds important
A time-consuming job in which he participates annually with a number of volunteers from Staatsbosbeheer. Today the small songbirds have to be ringed, but he is also regularly involved in ringing large waterfowl that travel to our country to forage here in winter. An important activity. Not only to monitor the migratory bird population in the Netherlands, but also to learn more about the spread of animal diseases among birds. Small migratory birds also spread diseases, such as the bird flu virus, which we would rather not get in the Netherlands.
 Shiny new ring
This blue probably doesn't spread the bird virus that's prevalent now, he says, providing the little bird with a shiny new ring around its paw. ""But the bird can, for example, have the subtropical West Nile virus among its members. That virus has already been found in a warbler in the Netherlands this year,"" says Bredenbeek. ""Through the ringing, we and the researchers learn more about the spread. And that's how it works with the bird flu virus."" By ringing geese and ducks, researchers from the University of Wageningen, among others, can learn more about the origin of the migratory birds that bring the dangerous bird flu virus. Rings great © Marielle Beumer RTV Oost
 Origin
During ringing, wild geese and ducks from the cloaca, the bird's poop hole, are collected from which the researchers can find out whether the animal has bird flu. ""That does not mean that the bird dies from this, but it does form a source of contamination for the poultry sector in the area where it resides with its faeces,"" says Bredenbeek. ""But that does not mean that the water bird is also the cause of the infection in a chicken farmer. The bird can also spread the virus through hosts."" Bredenbeek points as an example to the great that he has firmly clamped in his hand. ""The bird virus can be transmitted via the droppings of waterfowl to the other birds that do not die from it themselves, but spread it further.""
 Alertness matters
The ringing of the birds is therefore important, but according to Bredenbeek it is even more important that everyone is currently alert to sick and dead waterfowl in nature reserves. ""We are alert. If there are structurally many dead birds in an area, we collect them and bring them to wageningen university where they are further investigated for the presence of bird flu viruses or other possible animal diseases.""
 No notifications yet
""So far, no reports have been received in the Kop van Overijssel and fortunately there are not many poultry farmers in the area here, so that makes a difference,"" says Bredenbeek while passing on the wing size and weight of a newly ringed blackbird to his colleague. Extra vigilance is the only thing that nature managers can contribute to the further spread of the bird flu virus. ""That's right, because we don't catch the birds we ring to inoculate them,"" he says with a laugh. ""We don't do that and the poultry farmers don't do that to their animals either, because they are no longer allowed to export the meat and eggs.""
 Best remedy
For the time being, the national cage obligation and the associated hygiene regulations are the best remedy for poultry farms to keep the bird flu virus out.

NQTB19752W,High temperatures intensify summer pests in Spain,"© Stock Mosquitoes, ticks or the tickling mosquito are some of the species that thrive in the Spanish summer. The temperature rise during heat waves promotes the exponential increase in their populations. As a result, in many cases they become harmful to humans.
Milagros Fernández, an expert in the field of pest control, has confirmed this to EFE. Fernández was also director-general of the National Association of Environmental Companies (ANECPLA). Due to the rise in temperatures this summer, the populations of pests are increasing sharply. 
""Excessive increase"" of tickling mosquito
The heat wave that swept across the country last week will cause an ""excessive increase"" in the volume of the black fly population, also known as tickle mosquito, an insect that reproduces on riverbanks with and associated increases in attacks on humans. 
The tickling mosquito ""does not transmit diseases,"" but Fernández does point out that his bite can be ""spectacular"" because it breaks the skin and can lead to infections and allergic reactions that in some cases require hospitalization.
The fact that the weather is good in Spain also means that many people are outside more, which also increases the chance of being bitten. Moreover, these outdoor activities lead to a greater amount of waste in different places and tickle mosquitoes are attracted to it.
Sign
Another animal that has spread this year is the tick, the number of which continues to grow. Not only in Spain but throughout Europe. In Spain, 20 species of ticks have already been counted. In general, their bite is painless and causes few symptoms: redness, swelling or a small sore on the skin. The greatest danger of ticks is that they can be carriers and spreaders of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever and Lyme disease if they themselves are infected with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Fernández notes that Crimean Congo fever was first seen in Spain only in 2013 and has since infected nine people, three of whom have died.
""The tick is one of the most dangerous parasites for humans,"" Fernández warns. It is true that a tick must first have bitten an animal with one of those diseases before it can infect a human with it. In Spain, the transmission of Crimean Congo fever is not too bad ""because fortunately crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is not widespread here, apart from some wild animals in areas in Extremadura, Castilla y León, Castilla-La Mancha and Madrid that are infected with it"".
Mosquitoes
Mosquitoes also pose a threat, especially those of the genus 'Culex perexiguus' - because of its drawing with stripes better known as tiger mosquito - are vectors of the West Nile virus that caused 77 cases in Spain in 2020 - 40 confirmed and 37 probable - of meningoencephalitis, according to the National Centre of Epidemiology (CNE).
Wasps and bees
The bites of these insects increase considerably in the summer, because that is when they are most active and people spend more time outdoors. In addition, the Asian wasp has also been found in Spain for several years. That's an invasive species that's now widely seen in areas along the Cantabrian coast and Galicia. The Asian giant hornbill has also been spotted in Spain. This one is even more dangerous and aggressive than the Asian wasp. It is especially important for people with allergies to their poison to be careful. According to the college of pharmacists in Spain, 3 percent of the population is allergic to the poison of wasps or bees. Every year 3 to 4 people die from an allergic reaction in Spain. Currently, the most effective treatment for people with allergies is the vaccine, which has a success rate of almost 95%.

The rise in temperatures is one of the main causes of this increase in the number of west Nile virus cases. Juanjo Carmona, WWF's coordinator for Doñana, reports that the virus also reached Spain years ago, but did not ""find the conditions to reproduce,"" causing it to quickly disappear. Both Carmonda and Fernández consider proper ""epidemiological surveillance"" to be the key to reducing this increase in the number of cases of disease transmission. This makes it possible to know when an animal has a certain disease, to increase the alarm level and to keep infections under control.
The person responsible for the topic of climate change at Ecologistas en Acción, Javier Andaluz, indicates that not all types of insects benefit from the rise in temperature. He points to species that have ""certain problems"" due to the imbalance in the flowering cycles of the plants they feed on and disappear earlier.

In 2020, some infections with the West Nile virus (WNV) were found in Utrecht and the surrounding area, caused by local mosquito bites. Hans Zaaijer, head of the Blood Transferable Infections department at Sanquin: ""That was an important moment for us. We had foreseen it. For years, this virus has been emerging more and more north in Europe during the mosquito season. Recently, the virus had reached Germany, across the Alps. That is why we have expanded the testing capacity. Because most people do not suffer from a WNV infection, and precisely because of this it can be unnoticed in the donated blood and be transmitted. For a patient receiving that blood, such an infection can be very dangerous. So we have to intercept them in time."" UsutuvirusSanquin Research tested more than 75,000 donations from Dutch risk areas for genetic material from the WNV in 2020 and 2021, but found no infections. ""Once a donor seemed infected,"" adds Hans Zaaijer. ""With such a positive test result, confirmation tests are needed, because the WNV is very closely related to, among other things, the Usutu virus. That virus caused substantial mortality among blackbirds in 2016-2018. Additional tests eventually showed that it was an infection with Usutuvirus. Fortunately, that is not harmful to people."" If on 1 December no new WNV infection has been found in donors, Sanquin will stop this screening of donors for now. Next mosquito season it will not be resumed. If WNV reappears in humans at a later date, the test protocol can be restarted quickly: the equipment and experience remain available. The West Nile virusThe West Nile virus is slowly moving from the south to the north of Europe. It is a virus that is spread via mosquitoes and birds. People can also become infected with WNV through a mosquito bite. When people become infected, they usually don't get sick. About 80 percent get no symptoms, 20 percent show mild symptoms, such as fever and flu-like symptoms. In less than 1 percent of cases, an infection can lead to serious complaints of the brain and nervous system.

X2L0T8U8FK,"Theme of the State of Zoonoses 2020 is ""emerging zoonoses""","Theme of the State of Zoonoses 2020 is ""emerging zoonoses""

The government is taking various measures against emerging zoonoses
The COVID-19 pandemic and the outbreak of the West Nile virus in 2020 show that the so-called emerging zoonoses pose a risk to the Netherlands. Zoonoses are diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans. Emerging zoonoses are new or known zoonoses that can appear suddenly or whose number of infections suddenly increases sharply. In the State of Zoonoses 2020, these emerging zoonoses are the theme.
Emerging zoonosesIn the thematic chapter, the authors of the State of Zoonoses pay attention to the emerging zoonoses that are important for the Netherlands. For example, bird flu and the tick-borne encephalitis virus are discussed. The latter virus can cause brain (membrane) inflammation via infected ticks. This virus was diagnosed in 12 people in the Netherlands between 2016 and 2020.
The government is taking various measures against emerging zoonoses, such as careful monitoring and notification obligations for these types of diseases. The authors of the report also discuss the driving forces that can lead to these emerging zoonoses. An example of this is climate change. 
West Nile virusIn September 2020, an infection with the West Nile virus was discovered for the first time in the Netherlands in a bird (warbler). This virus occurs in birds and is transmitted by mosquitoes that feed on blood from infected birds. These mosquitoes spread the virus to other birds and sometimes also to humans and other mammals, such as horses. In October 2020, the virus was first detected in 8 people in the Netherlands. 
In general, most people don't get sick from an infection with the virus. About 1 in 5 of infected people get mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache and muscle aches. Approximately 1 percent of infected people get a serious illness, such as brain inflammation.
COVID-19 in minkAlso animals, and especially mink, were found to be able to be infected with the new coronavirus (SARSsevere acute respiratory syndrome-CoVcoronavirus-2), the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans. The government wanted to use measures to prevent mink from transmitting the coronavirus to humans. Despite the measures, the number of infections among these farms continued to rise. That is why it was decided in 2020 to stop mink farming in the Netherlands earlier than had been agreed. 
Every year, RIVMNational Institute for Public Health and the Environment, commissioned by the NVWADutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority, makes an overview of the most important zoonoses and indicates how often they occur in the Netherlands. It concerns the zoonoses that doctors must report to the GGDMunicipal Health Service and that veterinarians must report to the NVWA. Policymakers can use this information to take targeted action if necessary.

Y80IFM0RJR,Andalusia starts prevention plan against new West Nile virus outbreak,"Andalusia starts prevention plan against new West Nile virus outbreak

© ------------
In most cases, mild, flu-like symptoms develop after an infection with West Nile virus, but in exceptional cases these can become severe and lead to paralysis, permanent nerve disorders or even death. Although this virus is mainly found in countries with a warm climate, in October last year someone was infected with the West Nile virus for the first time in the Netherlands.
In Andalusia, the mosquito season is just around the corner when soon 40 thousand hectares of rice fields - especially in the province of Seville - will be flooded and the temperature will rise. The regional government of Andalusia wants to monitor the presence of the West Nile virus immediately at the start of this mosquito season. Why there was such a large virus outbreak in Spain last year, experts have not yet been able to determine with certainty.
Early control of mosquito larvae
At the end of April, a large-scale check on horses in Andalusia will start that will function as a barometer for the presence of the virus. West Nile fever is transmitted to horses and humans via mosquitoes that have received the virus from birds. From May, the entire prevention plan will be put into effect and toxic bacteria will be used to combat the mosquito larvae, among other things. Furthermore, in the areas of the rice fields, the use of mosquito nets and anti-mosquito spray is recommended and also the wearing of long sleeves and long trousers. 
PCR tests in female mosquitoes
Scientists will perform PCR tests on the female mosquitoes in the two mosquito species that occur in Andalusia to determine the viral load. Monitoring the presence of West Nile virus in insects is an effective prevention method because the virus is only found in humans months later. The conditions this year are the same as last year, because it has also rained heavily and there has been little human activity due to the pandemic. Now only a temperature increase has to cause an explosive increase in the mosquito population.  
Exceptional outbreak in 2020 
Last year's West Nile virus outbreak was the largest in Spanish history. Normally 1 in 1000 mosquitoes is infected with this virus, last year that was the case with 1 in 25 mosquitoes. Between 6 August and 30 November 2020, 77 human infections were recorded, of which 57 in the province of Seville, 14 in Cádiz and 6 in Badajoz. 95 percent of people who developed West Nile fever had to be hospitalized. Also, last year, more than 130 horses contracted west nile fever caused by the virus.",https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vaW5zcGFuamUubmwvem9yZy13ZWx6aWpuLzE1OTcyL2FuZGFsdXNpZS1zdGFydC1tZXQtcHJldmVudGllcGxhbi10ZWdlbi1uaWV1d2UtdWl0YnJhYWstd2VzdG5pamx2aXJ1cy_SAQA?oc%3D5,EN,NL,2022-10-21 18:52:16,2021-04-27 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),
ZVVGPIV7T5,Travellers wanted for research on mosquitoes,"Travellers wanted for research on mosquitoesMerlin MulderWednesday 28 July 2021 at 13:00LeidenFor a large study of mosquitoes, 1,000 travellers are being sought. The UMC Utrecht and the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) started the research this week. The 'One Health Travel study' examines, among other things, the viral infections such as the West Nile virus, Chikungunya, Dengue, tick cephalitis and the Zika virus infection. These infections are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito or tick. For the study, 1,000 travelers are looking for who go on holiday in Europe (including the Netherlands) or the Caribbean Netherlands. Participants are asked during the trip, via an app, to keep track of data about their health, activities during the trip and mosquito nuisance they experience. When they return home, they take some blood themselves with a finger prick, which is tested for the prevention of mosquito-borne infections. The researchers hope to get a better picture of the spread of diseases by mosquitoes. The Netherlands is vulnerable to outbreaks of these viral diseases, because there is a lot of water here, many people live close to each other and there are many cattle around. It is not yet known how big the risk is that travelers within Europe and the Caribbean Netherlands run when it comes to diseases that can transmit ticks and mosquitoes. The symptoms are often mild and a bit like the flu. Usually travelers do not go to a doctor for this. ""The unnoticed infections among returning travellers may, in the future, pose a danger to public health. It is not that far yet, but it is important to properly map this threat', according to the researchers. Interested travellers can find more information and register online via the study website: www.

The Greek government is warning all summer visitors to the country to prepare for a possible West Nile virus epidemic. Last year's outbreak proved to be a disease in Greece, which spread from Africa to the migratory bird country, according to the Greek Centre for -----------------. In 2018, 316 cases of hive infection and 50 deaths were reported in Greece, the highest since 2012. The British Foreign Office and the US Embassy in Athens are also warning of the possibility of infection. Protective measuresResponsors recommend wearing long sleeves and using mosquito protectors. Mosquitoes and mosquito nets are still the most effective for preventing stings, as mosquitoes find victims mainly during sleep. They mostly feed on plant food, but females need protein after mating, so they find animal and human blood. They're found at dawn and dusk.

The Greek government has also approved additional measures to combat the spread of the virus and mosquitoes. They primarily go in the direction of destroying the natural habitat of mosquitoes and suppressing their reproduction. They also point out that this is impossible in the vicinity of standing waters, as the presence of mosquitoes is inevitable there. African virusInfesti post of West Nile virus, although it shows no symptoms of the disease, a statement from the President of the Greek Centre for Inguing Diseases tells the Guardian. Only about 20 percent experience mild fever and flu-like signs of disease. The percentage of those infected, however, is caused by more severe complications and damage to the central nervous system. These more severe forms of the disease are expressed primarily as meningoencephalitis and, as a last resort, can lead to death.The spread of the West Nile virus is transmitted primarily by invasive mosquito species, such as tiger mosquitoes brought to Europe by humans. In addition to Greece, cases have also been dealt with in Croatia, Serbia and Italy in the past year. Only two people have been infected in Slovenia so far, but the National Institute of Public Health has a plan in place in the event of a major outbreak. Mosquitoes reproduce in standing waters and puddles where their larvae live. While dragonflies and pacile frogs prey on them in the ponds and ponds, there are no such natural enemies in the cities.

The bad news about the threat to public health has been really great over the last two years, too. However, it seems that we will have to live with them in the future, taking into account a number of safeguards. There's a new type of mosquito on the march that's already reached our destinations and could transmit a severe form of the disease. The good news, at least, is that medicine and science know the solution to it.

There are more than 100 species of mosquitoes, two of which are major carriers of the disease. ----- mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus) and the Egyptian tiger mosquito (Aedes aegypti) transmit viruses that can be fatal to humans, including West Nile virus, yellow fever virus and dengue virus, so understanding their life stages can help guide effective disease prevention measures.
In many parts of the world, mosquito-borne diseases have been battling for decades. It is only recalled that malaria, one of the biggest health problems of an underdeveloped world, is difficult to overcome, even if it can be successfully defied by the vaccine. We have also written in our journal about an attempt to use genetic engineering to prevent the development of mosquitoes that carry this dangerous disease.
But before one of the health problems at risk is resolved, another is already on the move. Experts around the world are currently describing the emergence and spread of a highly aggressive Japanese mosquito in places where it has not been known before. He has also settled in our country and in some parts of Europe, transmitting a virus of a dangerous disease called Japanese encephalitis. 
What do we know about the Japanese mosquito?
Its living environment is forests and other areas rich in vegetation. It also often settles in urban settlements with parks and gardens. He immigrated to us from areas of Southeast Asia and, like other mosquito species, feeds mainly on blood.
It is also known that the Japanese mosquito (Aedes japonicus) is even more aggressive than tiger and ranks third in the world of the 100 most invasive mosquito species. This characteristic can be attributed precisely to his extraordinary ability to survive in challenging situations. In Europe, it is currently domesticated in a slightly cooler environment than in Asia, where it originated, and it can be assumed that it will soon spread to warmer areas.
It looks similar to what's now a well-known --------------, except it's a little bigger. Another peculiarity: he is very aggressive and active day and night. Painful and itchy stings can turn into a real nuisance. Experts are concerned that even in our environment, diseases could start to spread due to the viruses it transmits. They mainly mention Japanese encephalitis, inflammation of brain tissue. Signs of the disease include severe headache, fever and convulsions and other neurological problems such as disturbances of consciousness, speech or walking. Patient mortality is 30 percent and 50 percent of survivors have permanent neurological or psychological consequences.
The vaccine is effective
Panic is not necessary, but spread needs to be monitored, experts warn. No disease has been reported in Europe so far. For now, the good case is that both the virus and the mosquito should have exactly the same environment for development and transmission as it is in Southeast Asia.
The other good news is that the spread of the disease, if it also occurs in Europe, could be prevented by vaccination. An effective and proven vaccine is available, which is already safe for two-month-old children. Nevertheless, it is important to draw attention in a timely manner to the expansion of the mosquito's habitat and the potential consequences.
Slovenia in the red zone
The Venetian province's website in neighbouring Italy has already published the first warnings, mentioning that around 50,000 sufferers of Japanese encephalitis are recorded worldwide annually, of which tens of thousands are fatal. Italian sources report the rapid spread of the mosquito in the north of the Apenton Peninsula, but it can be concluded that it is only a matter of time before it starts to spread southward, where it will surely find the right conditions for development.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of ecdc, which last year published a map of the prevalence of the Japanese mosquito, on which Slovenia is fully coloured red, is also pointed out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which published a map of the prevalence of the Japanese mosquito, on which Slovenia is fully coloured red, which means that it is a mosquito throughout the country. Even smaller border areas, such as the province of Friuli in Italy and Istria in Croatia and parts of Austria, are also marked. In fact, Slovenia looks on this map for the presence of a mosquito rather than a peripheral area where mosquitoes should only be expected. It is also present in parts of Germany, but has not yet been detected in the rest of Europe.
No warnings about this potential health problem can be found on the NIJZ website, except for brief information on the possibility of vaccination against Japanese encephalitis in the event of travel to areas at such risk. Dengue and dengue fever diseases transmitted by ----- and Egyptian tiger mosquitoes are described in more detail.

Belgrade - Serbia has already claimed nine lives in Serbia this year and 102 cases of infection with this tropical virus have been dealt with, the Serbian Institute of Public Health said on Tuesday.

The mosquito-borne virus was first spotted in Serbia in July 2012 and 574 cases of infection were reported by the end of 2017. Sixty-one people died, according to Serbian news agency Tanjug.

Man Random Host

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus culex, and the natural reservoir for the virus is different bird species, while humans are a random host. In principle, the virus is not transmitted from it. The time from infection to onset of the disease is usually three to 14 days after infection.

The Slovenian National Institute of Public Health points out that natural features also allow the existence of a transporter in Slovenia and together with data from neighbouring countries indicate the possibility of the west nile virus in Slovenia.

There are no antiviral medicines

Most infected people show no signs of the disease or have signs of flu similar to fever, headache, muscle pain and fatigue. In some cases, the disease may have a severe course together with the central nervous system. This occurs in about one in 150 infected.

People over the age of 50 and people with impaired immunity are at higher risk of a more severe course of the disease. Mild forms of the disease do not require treatment and are spontaneously resolved. Severe forms of the disease, however, usually require hospital admission. But there are no effective antiviral drugs.",https://news.google.com/__i/rss/rd/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlbG8uc2kvbm92aWNlL3N2ZXQvdmlydXMtemFob2RuZWdhLW5pbGEtemFodGV2YWwtemUtdmVjLXppdmxqZW5qLWxhaGtvLXByaWRlLXR1ZGktdi1zbG92ZW5pam8v0gEA?oc%3D5,EN,SL,2022-11-28 12:12:03,2020-10-13 09:00:09+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

The other good news is that the spread of the disease, if it also occurs in Europe, could be prevented by vaccination. An effective and proven vaccine is available, which is already safe for two-month-old children. Nevertheless, it is important to draw attention in a timely manner to the expansion of the mosquito's habitat and the potential consequences.
Slovenia in the red zone
The Venetian province's website in neighbouring Italy has already published the first warnings, mentioning that around 50,000 sufferers of Japanese encephalitis are recorded worldwide annually, of which tens of thousands are fatal. Italian sources report the rapid spread of the mosquito in the north of the Apenton Peninsula, but it can be concluded that it is only a matter of time before it starts to spread southward, where it will surely find the right conditions for development.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control of ecdc, which last year published a map of the prevalence of the Japanese mosquito, on which Slovenia is fully coloured red, is also pointed out by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which published a map of the prevalence of the Japanese mosquito, on which Slovenia is fully coloured red, which means that it is a mosquito throughout the country. Even smaller border areas, such as the province of Friuli in Italy and Istria in Croatia and parts of Austria, are also marked. In fact, Slovenia looks on this map for the presence of a mosquito rather than a peripheral area where mosquitoes should only be expected. It is also present in parts of Germany, but has not yet been detected in the rest of Europe.

JA8IJ5Z31J,Ancient diseases peri believe in persuad ice when warmth,"Ancient diseases peri believe in persuad ice when warmth

German news agency DPA recalled the 2016 case. At the time, several people suddenly fell ill on the Siberian Jamal Peninsula, 70 were treated in hospital and a 12-year-old even died. The cause was anthrax, a poison that has been abused by terrorists in the past, but this time it appeared in the natural environment.
According to the official version, the boy was infected with reindeer meat. After temperatures rose, they rose in areas previously ruled by perennial ice and infected through deciers of microbes.
Of course, the question arises about how dangerous the melting of the ice is and what lies beneath the ice. ""There is a lot of danger,"" says German virologist ----------------------. This adds that different bacteria, especially on the corpses of frozen animals, can survive for centuries.

Above average warm year
And this year, Siberia has been remarkably on the ups and down. May was the warmest since measurements began in 1979, and the biggest heat change was detected in Siberia, where the temperature this year was ten degrees higher than the average between 1981 and 2010. In Alaska and Antarctica, temperatures were also high above average.
Virologists now fear that melting ice will return to a world of diseases long forgotten. In the worst case, even the real epidemics, because even in these re-melting areas, centuries ago, the diseases of the deceased people, which remained a kind of survival unit for bacteria and microbes in the ice.
More than a decade ago, experts from the American Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found a mass burial site in The Inuites. A woman's body has been exhitract from a two-metre-deep grave that has been in the ground for 75 years. The constant ice and body fat stores have neatly preserved the viruses in the corpse's lungs over more than seven decades. The viruses were preserved so well that researchers were able to prove that the Inuitas buried there died of Spanish flu. At the same time, they confirmed that the virus's strength fades over time and that the transmission of the infection is significantly slower and more severe.

Many viruses die when they are warm, bacteria are more resistant
It is also true that most viruses die shortly after the warm-up, as it encounters environmental impacts. The most likely infection is if animals or humans come into contact with the virus immediately after the body has been deced. Bacteria are more resistant, which is why they are more dangerous. Specifically, anthrax is extremely persistent and there have been cases in the past where whole herds of deer have been diseased. There have also been a number of reports of diseases in recent years, so many animals in the area have been vaccinated preventively.
Russian scientists who encountered microorganisms in Yakutia in northeast Siberia two years ago are also very active. And according to their estimates, there is a very high risk that when today's bacteria interact with ""prehistoric ones,"" unknown mutations will occur. As a last resort, these could be very dangerous new species.
But viruses and bacteria and the anubergous ice are not the only growing threat to the transmission of infectious diseases. Scientists also warn of mosquitoes, flies and ticks. It has long been known that these carry diseases in tropical places, but in the temperate zone transmissions are increasingly common after warm-up, as all these insects are becoming easier and more likely to survive mild winters. Even those species that come with travelers from warm places.

With a record may temperature in Siberia, there are fears of an anthrax outbreak in the liver in Russia, and indirectly poisoning people who are vitally dependent on their meat. In 2016, they already had a minor eruption on the Jamal Peninsula. Photo: AP

Temperatures in the Arctic Circle are rising drastically, about three times faster than in the rest of the world, the World Bank study says. *** and permafrost are melting, which not only accelerates climate change, but poses a threat to the recovery of the frozen infectious agents of the disease, which is being paid a great deal of attention after the pandemic of the new coronavirus.
Frozen pathogens Permafrost – by geographical definition, permanently frozen soil – is an extremely good saver for microbes and viruses because there is cold, dark and no oxygen in the frozen soil. Scientific studies show that some pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses and fungi, can survive after freezing for hundreds or thousands of years or even a few million years. For example, in 1998, scientists discovered fragments of ribonucleic acid (RNA) of the Spanish flu virus from 1918 in corpses buried in a mass grave in the village of Brevig Mission, Alaska. In 2005, the entire virus was reconstructed in the laboratory. The infection caused by 75 years ago of dead deer Is even more alarming and a realistic example is from near 2016. At that time, several people suddenly fell ill on the Jamal Peninsula, which is from Western Siberia into the Arctic Ocean, and 70 were treated in hospital and a 12-year-old even died. The cause was anthrax, a poison that has been abused by terrorists in the past, but this time it appeared in the natural environment. According to the official explanation from the Russian authorities, the deceased boy was infected with ingested meat. After a heatwave in the summer of 2016, deer were found in areas of the then-stauish permafrost and are thought to have been infected by defrosted microbes from the corpses of deer that died 75 years ago.

The melting of permafrost is already affecting the environment in Siberia, where the oil infrastructure in Norisk was damaged and where there was therefore a large spill of fuel into the river and Lake Pjasina. Photo: AP

Viruses fail quickly, and bacteria are more persistent Most viruses die soon after they warm up, as they encounter environmental impacts. The most likely infection is if animals or humans come into contact with the virus immediately after the animal or human body has been deced. Bacteria are more resistant, which is why they are more dangerous. A particularly anthrax is extremely persistent and there have been cases in the past where whole herds of reindeer have been diseased. In recent years, too, there have been a number of reports of diseases, which is why many animals in Siberia have been vaccinated preventively. At the beginning of the 20th century, more than one million deer died due to an anthrax in northern Russia, the last eruption occurred in 1941. The permafrost made it understandably difficult to excavate deep graves. According to the Russian authorities, as many as 7,000 burial sites with anthrax of infected deer from a century ago are known. What's under the ice?"" There is a huge risk,"" says German virologist ********************** for the German agency DPA. Chanasit points out that different bacteria, especially on the corpses of frozen animals, can survive for centuries.
The warmest May in Siberia This year has been a huge coup for Siberia. May was the warmest since measurements began in 1979, and the biggest heat change was detected in Siberia, where the temperature this year was ten degrees higher than the average between 1981 and 2010. In Alaska and Antarctica, temperatures were also high above average. In the world's largest country, Russia covers as much as two-thirds of the area. Even if the Russian permafrost is called permafrost forever frozen, the upper part of the permafrost is still slightly thaled in the summer. In Yakutia in the northeast of Siberia, the ground can be deced for two or three metres, leading to picturesque scenes and infrastructure damage. The Russians most concerned about smallpox from 130 years agoVirologists fear that melting ice will return to a world of diseases long forgotten. In the worst case, even real epidemics, because even in these re-entraned areas, centuries ago, the diseases of the deceased people, which remained a kind of survival unit for bacteria and microbes, were buried in the ice. In a 2011 study, authors *********** and Marina Podolna wrote: ""As a result of the melting of permafrost, the carriers of the deadly infections of the 18th and 19th centuries may return, especially near the cemeteries where the victims of these infections were buried."" After 1890, there was a larger outbreak of smallpox in Siberia. Some settlements, particularly in the northeast of ********, have lost up to 40 percent of the population.

A person from Coria del Río is admitted for meningoencephalitis due to West Nile Virus, according to a statement from the Ministry of Health and Families.
When the result of the tests is known, all the protocols have been activated immediately, as well as the planned public health measures. This case has been confirmed by the reference laboratory (Hospital Virgen de las Nieves de Granada) and the National Center for Microbiology.
Preventive measures
From the Epidemiological Surveillance Service it is recalled that there is no transmission from person to person and that such transmission is by bite, thus, the measures to prevent infection in humans are based on avoiding mosquito bites, so it is recommended:
Use mosquito nets on windows and doors.
Try not to stay outdoors between dusk and dawn.
You have to try to leave the light off.
Proper body hygiene must be followed daily.
Avoid intense perfumes.
Wear clothing that covers the skin as much as possible and shake it before using it if it has been lying outside.
Make proper use of repellents, strictly following the recommendations on the mode and frequency of use described by the manufacturer. If you use sun cream, you have to apply it first, let it absorb for twenty minutes and, then, apply the mosquito repellent.
Actions carried out
From the Ministry of Health and Families of the Junta de Andalucía, various actions have been carried out after the outbreak of 2020, among which the creation of a group of experts in mosquito control with personnel from the CSIC, Mosquito Control Service of the Diputación de Huelva, University of Córdoba and technicians from the Junta de Andalucía of the organisms involved (animal health and wildlife control) stand out.
Following the guidelines of this group, as well as those promulgated by the ECDC for control programs before FNO, the Program of Integrated Surveillance and Control of Vectors of West Nile Fever was elaborated, which starts from the elaboration of a risk map, in which different layers overlap, such as the existence of wetland areas,  rainfall regime, temperature regime, and detection of culex mosquitoes and viruses in previous seasons.
This program establishes the need for each municipality with risk level 2 or higher, must carry out a municipal control and surveillance plan.
On the other hand, we have worked in coordination with animal health technicians to increase the sampling points of horses and strategically place them in the risk areas. This sampling is used as beacons that warn of the presence and circulation of the virus. In addition, this year this sampling has been advanced since May. Work is also being done to finalize the implementation of an autonomic entomological surveillance, which allows detecting the circulation of mosquitoes of the genus culex, the possible increase and the circulation of the virus in them.

The Generalitat announced on Friday the detection of mosquitoes with the West Nile virus in the municipality of Riudoms (Baix Camp). Specifically, the discovery has occurred in an equestrian club in the province of Tarragona, where last year a focus of the disease was already declared in horses. Although the Generalitat has been detecting cases in horses and birds since 2017, it is the first time that specimens of the mosquito that transmits the virus have been found. The ailment usually develops very mildly in people (four out of five cases are asymptomatic), although in 2021 it has already caused the death of an elderly woman in Andalusia. The community is, together with Extremadura, where more are detected: almost a hundred in 2020 alone.The virus is transmitted mainly between birds and the detection of mosquitoes does not imply officially declaring the disease, although the Government reported that it has activated the level 2 alert protocol. ""That the mosquito has been detected means that the virus is circulating,"" explains Sebastian Napp, an expert in veterinary epidemiology at the Institut de Recerca i Tecnologia Agroalimentàries (IRTA), attached to the Department of Climate Action, Food and Rural Agenda, and who has confirmed the presence of 30 Culex pipiens to set traps in the equestrian club. So far, the cases found since the first detection in a bird in 2017 are of lineage 2, the same that circulates in much of Central and Eastern Europe, where it is already widespread. Napp explains that pending analysis, it is most likely that the mosquitoes found with the virus also belong to lineage 2, which unlike type 1 is more pathogenic for humans and less for horses. ""The virus tends to disappear in winter and come back in summer. You can't predict exactly how it will evolve in the coming years,"" adds Napp, who sees climate change as a key factor in explaining its spread in colder countries such as Germany and the Netherlands.Napp adds that the disease does not usually develop severely in farm birds, although it does contract it and antibodies have been detected in some specimens. Also that 80% of infected horses will be asymptomatic for 20% who will have a fever. The Government reported that it is carrying out a sampling in birds and horses within a radius of 10 kilometers.

After the recent cases of Nile Fever in the province of Seville, the municipal delegation of Health, Consumption and Animal Welfare of the City of Puerto Real has launched an appeal to the population to take extreme precautions in order to avoid both the bite and the proliferation of mosquitoes vectors of the virus that causes the disease. In particular, avoid keeping stagnant water untreated in the properties. It is also recommended to use repellents, mosquito nets and not to walk next to stagnant water in the hours of less heat.
The City Council of Puerto Real has reported that, to date, the determinations of the 'Municipal Plan for Surveillance and Control of Vectors of West Nile Fever of Puerto Real' continue to be complied with ""scrupulously"", a document approved in May of this year 2021 by the Ministry of Health and Family. It specifies the measures to be carried out to control the proliferation of mosquitoes in the municipality.
As indicated in the Plan, technical staff of the Municipal Service of Health, Consumption and Animal Welfare, in the company of the personnel of the company in charge of the prevention contract 'Coplaga' and technicians of the territorial delegation of the Ministry of Health and Family, carry out weekly controls. In these, the efficacy of the larvicide treatments developed during the first phase in the possible foci of mosquito breeding, case of scuppers, fountains, lagoons ...
At the moment, the treatments followed have had an efficacy of 100%, since no larvae have been detected in the inspected foci, they point out from the Consistory.

When the social alarm about an outbreak such as the West Nile virus is extinguished, which in 2020 claimed eight deaths and 71 infected in Andalusia (and six in other communities, according to José Miguel Cisneros, director of the infectious diseases unit of the Virgen del Rocío Hospital in Seville), only the pain for the dead and the sequelae of the sick remain. To alleviate this discomfort, clinical experts are now investigating, a year and a half later, how those affected react to the pathogen and thus face the next outbreaks with better clinical weapons. Among those who were bitten by a Culex perexiguus mosquito and were affected by meningoencephalitis – 1% of the total – are children, adolescents and adults with cognitive and motor problems, including quadriplegia and severe neurological problems. ""My five-year-old son suffers from endogirism [walking with his feet inward] in his left leg, muscle weakness and above all loss of motor skills, although he has been recovering them,"" says Israel Espinosa, a resident of Coria del Río, a town on the banks of the Guadalquivir River very close to Seville and where the outbreak arose. The Nile virus travels thanks to migratory birds, which are bitten by mosquitoes that later transmit it to horses and people through new bites. In the spring of 2020, confinement, heavy rains and uncontrolled stagnant waters multiplied mosquitoes in the riverside villages near Doñana and unleashed the outbreak – the largest recorded in Spain after five isolated cases in 2010 and 2016. Last summer the infections were reduced to one deceased person and six infected, but it was evident that the virus is here to stay. The available vaccine only protects horses, and the development of antivirals or immunizations for humans is pending. In the United States, the virus is the leading cause of meningoencephalitis and as of 2015, 45,000 infections had been reported. While the attack of the virus in adults and its effects are clear, there are gaps in the reaction of infected children. Of the six children who fell ill in Andalusia, only two still have serious sequelae, and one is only now beginning to recognize his parents and try to verbalize and eat. A team from the Virgen del Rocío Hospital, which has treated the vast majority of infected people, led by the head of pediatric infectious diseases Olaf Neth, has studied the prevalence of the virus in children after extracting blood samples from 209 children of the total of 5,176 who live in Coria del Río. Only three (1.5%) were infected, when the percentage in adults is around 5%, according to experts. In parallel, the Sevillian pediatric team completed by doctors Inés Marín, Marta Aboza and Dolores Falcón wants to find out, in collaboration with the Necker Hospital in Paris, if the six children who developed severe symptoms had failures in their immune system. ""We have to understand why they have suffered symptoms. It could be bad luck, but I don't believe in it, so we look for why one child gets infected and another doesn't, and why some develop symptoms and others don't,"" Neth sums up. The initial thesis is that the risk of developing meningoencephalitis in children is much higher from the spread of the Nile virus than from other pathogens. The researchers also seek to develop a Europe-wide registry with children affected by this pathogen to prevent future infections and develop supportive treatments. An operator fumigates gardens in Coria del Río after the outbreak of West Nile virus in 2020.José Manuel Vidal (EFE)As a lesson learned, Cisneros highlights that meningoencephalitis caused by this virus should be taken into account especially for clinical diagnosis during the summer months and that doctors should be aware that those hospitalized ""are the tip of the iceberg."" ""If we advance the clinical suspicion to the fever phase we could advance the health alert. The diagnostic protocol was useful, but we continue with the need for training of infectious disease doctors. The listeria virus, the West Nile virus and the coronavirus have given us a lesson in humility stopping the world and showing that with globalization no one is safe, something that requires very well trained doctors. It is an anachronism that Spaniards are not treated by specialists when they have serious infections, it is a hole in the system, ""recalls Cisneros, former president of the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, a specialty that does not exist in the system MIR.La meningoencephalitis (involvement of the brain and meninges) has a high mortality of around 9% and serious sequelae also in more than 10% of patients.

UBTLLFRTIB,The Junta de Andalucía confirms a new case of the Nile virus in Seville,"The Junta de Andalucía confirms a new case of the Nile virus in Seville

The Ministry of Health and Families has confirmed a new case of West Nile virus in Seville, in the town of Castilblanco de los Arroyos. The affected is admitted to the Virgen Macarena University Hospital, as reported by the Ministry through the General Directorate of Public Health and Pharmaceutical Management. 

The case has been confirmed by the reference laboratory in Granada and, after the result of the tests, all the protocols and public health measures provided for in them have been activated. As established in points seven and ten of the West Nile Fever (FNA) Comprehensive Vector Surveillance and Control Program, Health and Families has convened the steering committee.

Four infected so far this year

In August, this disease claimed its first fatality of the year, a woman from Coria del Río (Seville), but the outbreak reached two other people in Seville. One of them came from the town of Coria del Río and required hospitalization, while the other infected, a resident of Villamanrique de la Condesa, did not present a serious case. 

Since last 2020, when seven people lost their lives in an outbreak of meningoencephalitis due to this virus, the Ministry has carried out various actions to try to stop the transmission of the disease.

Andalusia's battle against mosquitoes

Among the measures is the creation of a group of experts in mosquito control that has staff from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). The West Nile Fever Vector Surveillance and Control Program was also developed, which is based on the development of a risk map in which different factors overlap, such as the existence of wetland areas, rainfall regime, temperature regime, and detection of culex mosquitoes and viruses in previous seasons.

Likewise, and since the development of this program, it was established the need for each municipality with risk level 2 or higher to carry out a Municipal Control and Surveillance Plan. After detecting the first presence of the virus this year in August, the Ministry of Health and Families transferred this information to the affected municipalities to intensify control measures and execute these plans.

On the other hand, the Ministry recalls that it has worked in coordination with animal health technicians to increase the sampling points of horses and strategically place them in the risk areas. This sampling is used as ""beacons"" that warn of the presence and circulation of the virus. In addition, this year the sampling has been advanced since the month of May. 

Recommendations to prevent transmission

From the Epidemiological Surveillance Service it is recalled that there is no human-to-human transmission of the virus and that such transmission is by bite, so the measures to prevent infection in humans are based on avoiding mosquito bites. Thus, it is recommended to use mosquito nets on windows and doors, try not to stay outdoors between dusk and dawn and try to leave the light off.

Following a correct body hygiene daily is another of the actions that are proposed. Also, wearing clothes that cover the skin as much as possible, shaking it before using it if it has been lying outside, and making proper use of repellents, are measures that become indispensable when it comes to avoiding being a victim of insects.  ""If you use sun cream, you have to apply it first, let it absorb for twenty minutes and then apply the mosquito repellent,"" they add.",https://www.rtve.es/noticias/20210923/junta-andalucia-confirma-nuevo-caso-virus-nilo-sevilla/2173862.shtml,EN,ES,2022-06-18 12:58:19,2021-09-23 15:46:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),
X4NINR59QC,Nile virus: rice farmers deny that their crops are those that favor mosquito breeding,"Nile virus: rice farmers deny that their crops are those that favor mosquito breeding

The Federation of Rice Growers of Seville has questioned this Tuesday that its crops have to do with the increase in mosquitoes that transmit the West Nile virus, as well as with the cases of this disease, with three people infected, neighbors of Coria del Río and Villamanrique, one of whom has died.
However, aware of the ""magnitude of the problem"", they say in a statement that they want to ""be part of the solution"" and advocate ""preventive treatments"", so they have made available to the Administration all the means available to the federation (Integrated Production technicians, coordination with flight companies ...).
In this sense, the federation recalls that it has fewer and fewer active materials with which to fight, hence a reduction in the area of rice in Europe, and that for many years it has not had authorized insecticidal products for crop pests in Seville.
The rice farmers regret the death and situation of the other two affected, but show their ""disagreement"" with the references made in the media to their arable area. Thus, they point out that the planting of rice is not exclusive in the area and there are other irrigated crops of the Guadalquivir Marshes.
They also remember that the Sevillian rice field is in ""constant movement"" and that 75% of the water received is returned to the ""clean and crystalline"" river. The rice marshes perform an ""important work of natural filter of the turbidity that the Guadalquivir River presents"", fundamental for the biodiversity of the estuary.
Faced with warnings by scientists and technicians from municipalities that mosquitoes from the surroundings of rice areas could be reaching inhabited areas, the sector stresses ""that these are healthy wetlands where there is no stagnant water"" and that it would be necessary to look for the foci of stranded water in areas where these characteristics can be appreciated,  as some near natural landscapes, rivers and tributaries of Guadalquivir -they even mention the Ríopudio- or swimming pools, troughs, cisterns or drains.
""So far, both in 2020, and to date in 2021, no case of infection by the Nile Virus mosquito has been detected in any town or municipality inside the rice marshes of Seville, a sector in which more than 5,000 people work, many of them in direct contact with rice paddies and that represents almost 2% of the jobs of Andalusia""

XW462A4A9M,"What is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever? These are its symptoms, its causes and its consequences","What is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever? These are its symptoms, its causes and its consequences

A few years ago, cases of a mysterious disease that had originally affected Soviet soldiers in the Crimean peninsula and some people in remote regions of the (then still so called) Belgian Congo began to appear in Europe (and more specifically in Spain). As with other diseases such as Zika or West Nile virus, anthropogenic climate change has a lot to do with this phenomenon. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a zoonosis (a disease that animals can transmit to people) caused by a virus belonging to the Family Nairoviridae (Nairovirus) and endemic to Africa, the Balkans, Bulgaria, Turkey and the East Medio.Se transmitted to people or through the bite of ticks (Ixodoidea) that have bitten infected animals,  or by contact with blood, fluids or tissues of infected people or animals. Therefore, most cases in humans occur in people who are in close contact with animals, such as farmers, veterinarians or slaughterhouse operators. However, the most common route is undoubtedly the first; and this, in combination with the effects of climate change, explains its advance through the Iberian Peninsula. Many of the species of ticks capable of transmitting this virus travel on the backs of migratory birds that, in summer, move from Africa to Europe. Formerly, these ticks, however, could only survive in some areas of the south of the Peninsula, since the cold of winter ended with them. Now, instead, their distribution in Spain and Portugal has changed, and they are no longer as present in their original habitat (which has become too hot and dry) and, instead, they thrive in the rest of the Peninsula except for high-altitude mountainous areas. In the last five years, there have been five deaths in Spain due to endemic infections. Not only that; these ticks, until now, were unable to survive in Central Europe. Today, specimens have begun to be found as far north as the United Kingdom or Noruega.Se it is a very serious condition, which in people reaches mortality rates between 10 and 40%. Fortunately, it is rare.What are its symptoms? While in animals it is an asymptomatic infection, in people it causes a severe picture that bursts in after an incubation of between one and thirteen days (usually between one and three in the case of tick bites and between five and six in the case of exposure to infected tissues). The first phase consists of fever, stiffness, chills, severe headaches, dizziness, neck pain, eye pain, photophobia, myalgia, malaise, nausea, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea. Along with this, psychiatric symptoms such as mood swings, confusion and aggressiveness occur in the first two days and lassitude, depression and drowsiness next. Less commonly, hepatomegaly and skin redness appear with injected conjunctiva or chemosis (inflammation of the conjunctiva). After that, the disease progresses and the patient may experience tachycardia, slight hypotension, lymphadenopathy, enanthema, throat petechiae, tonsils and buccal mucosa, petechial redness of the trunk and limbs and ecchymosis. The next stage is characterized by bleeding: nasal, vomit, stool, urine, gingival, vaginal, ear, eye, injection site, and internal (including intraperitoneal and intracranial). In the most severe cases, the patient suffers hepatorenal and pulmonary failure from the fifth day with drowsiness, stupor, coma, jaundice and death. On the other hand, patients who improve begin to do so from the ninth or tenth day, but the recovery extends to more than a month and is marked by asthenia, conjunctivitis, slight confusion and amnesia. Treatment of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is quite complicated. Normally, the antiviral ribavirin is administered, although it has limited efficacy. Therefore, there is usually nothing left but supportive treatment (alleviating the effects of symptoms and providing life support) waiting for the infection to subside on its own. Attempts have been made to develop vaccines against this disease, but for now there is no safe and effective one. Thus, it is very important to take measures to prevent tick bites or contact with animal tissues or fluids in areas where the virus is present.",https://www.20minutos.es/salud/medicina/que-es-la-fiebre-hemorragica-de-crimea-congo-estos-son-sus-sintomas-sus-causas-y-sus-consecuencias-4882735/,EN,ES,2022-06-21 13:06:08,2021-11-08 09:07:06+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),
Z2VYWO96SW,The CSIC detects again the Nile virus in mosquitoes around the rice fields of La Puebla,"The CSIC detects again the Nile virus in mosquitoes around the rice fields of La Puebla

The team of the Doñana Biological Station responsible for the Guadalquivir Mosquito Observatory – which monitors the populations of insects that can transmit the West Nile virus and the circulation of the pathogen – sent a first report to the Board, on July 28, in which it warns not only of the significant increase in mosquitoes that can transmit the disease in rice areas of La Puebla del Río – which are being moving towards inhabited areas – but in which it records that the virus was detected already last week in the analyzes that are made to the captured mosquitoes.
The intensity of the infection is very similar to that registered in 2020, coinciding with the largest outbreak recorded in Spain of the disease, with 71 cases of meningoencephalitis in humans, a serious complication that occurs in less than 1% of those infected. Of those cases, 56 were in the province of Seville and began to emerge in August.
As corroborated yesterday by the main researcher of the center of the Higher Council for Scientific Research (CSIC), Jordi Figuerola, the increase in mosquitoes of the species that can transmit the virus, mainly Culex perexiguus, has been occurring for 15 days. In this way, it is already at levels similar to those of last year in the areas of rice fields near La Puebla del Río, agricultural areas where treatments against the larvae have not been done, although they were recommended from the beginning.
As for the pathogen, it has been detected in six cases out of every thousand specimens analyzed of Culex perexiguus, also at 2020 levels. The Doñana Biological Station carries out this monitoring in 15 places in the provinces of Seville and Huelva, although so far it has only been detected in that agricultural environment of La Puebla. There are no references from other areas of the province of Seville.

The first written report was sent to the Board and the municipalities on 28 July.

The presence of the virus has been notified and confirmed, as is mandatory, by the National Center for Microbiology, dependent on the Carlos III Health Institute, a reference center in Spain. Figuerola points out that before that written report to the Board, the data have been advanced to those responsible for Public Health, as well as to La Puebla and Coria del Río.
After knowing the report, both municipalities already warned the population of the situation and asked for an urgent meeting with the Board to implement a shock plan. The Ministry of Health announced yesterday that it will shortly convene the affected municipalities, although it points out that the increase in the mosquito population was foreseeable, as well as those meetings were planned to follow its evolution. The idea of the Board is to inform the municipalities of the measures to be taken in each municipality, in coordination with Health.
As it is transferred from the Doñana Biological Station, the increase in mosquitoes that can transmit the virus in the rice fields has been occurring for about 15 days, with concentrations of more than 400 specimens in a single trap in 24 hours in urban areas and more than 4,000 per trap in 24 hours in the rice fields of the species that can transmit the virus.
The experts of the Biological Station admit that they are ""very worried"" because there are a series of circumstances that can favor the transmission of the virus and consider that it is urgent to intervene in the municipalities and in that environment of the rice paddies near homes, with adulticidal treatments (to kill the adult mosquito), which are more problematic and not as effective as those of prevention with the larvae.
According to Figuerola, it is not even necessary to do it in all the hectares of rice fields that the province of Seville may have. Only in those that are close to inhabited areas and where this biological treatment against the larvae can not be applied or will not be effective at this point.
This control of agricultural farms at risk was already contemplated and recommended in the West Nile Fever Vector Surveillance and Control Program, which the Board published in March, although it delegated to the municipalities and municipal plans that they must prepare the analysis and the power to require the owners preventive treatments against mosquito larvae or against the adult mosquito. The most affected municipalities have denounced that it is something that exceeds their competences and their technical and economic capacity and that it is the Board, as competent in Public Health, which must implement a global plan that involves everyone.

Z8G9MRTI0U,Global climate change and the spread of West Nile Virus across Europe,"Global climate change and the spread of West Nile Virus across Europe

West Nile virus is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that is usually transmitted between birds and mosquitoes. Humans, horses, and other mammals can become infected, but they cannot transmit the virus to mosquitoes or other organisms. Infections in humans can be serious and lead to neurological diseases and death. Until recently, West Nile virus was only reported in Europe occasionally. The virus was believed to have entered Europe through infected migratory birds in sub-Saharan Africa. However, proliferation is currently a public health concern.

The general increase in temperatures as a result of global climate change is favoring the transmission of West Nile Virus in some areas of Europe, by creating more suitable conditions for the proliferation of the virus and its transmitting mosquitoes.

This is clear from a study by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA) of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) that analyzes the various causes why West Nile Virus has recently emerged as a major health problem in Europe due to its rapid spread. Scientists warn that the virus will spread to places further north in Europe due to a warmer climate.

In this study, the researchers wanted to find out why the disease has become so prevalent in Europe lately. To do this, they processed and analyzed large amounts of data from 166 regions of southern and southeastern Europe over a 13-year period, which highlighted changes in climate, land-use patterns, economic changes, and central government spending in areas such as sanitation and the environment.

According to Matthew Watts, principal investigator of the study, there is no simple explanation to describe the recent rise of West Nile Virus, but a combination of causes. In general, warmer weather in the spring and summer months due to climate change is making conditions more favorable for the virus and its mosquito vectors, accelerating the development of mosquitoes and extending their breeding season, which in turn can increase their numbers.

More importantly, warmer winters have likely allowed infected common female household mosquitoes (Culex pipiens) to survive winter in regions that were previously too cold (such as in northern Italy); therefore, the virus can now survive if mosquitoes weather the winter and spread early in the year. The results confirmed that regions with a higher proportion of wetlands and arable land, including irrigated agriculture that tends to attract susceptible birds and mosquito species, are most at risk of contracting the disease. ""Undoubtedly, switching other types of land use to irrigation may have increased the risk of disease,"" explains Watts, who states that drought may also be increasing the intensity of disease outbreaks, as reduced water resources cause mosquitoes and birds to come into closer contact and,  therefore, increase the possible cases of transmission and prevalence of the virus, which can then spread to human populations.

All of these environmental changes took place during a period of austerity in many countries. The countries that recorded the highest number of West Nile virus cases during the period analyzed were also the ones that implemented the largest cuts in government infrastructure and spending on risk prevention, for example, on environmental protection and wastewater spending, which could have benefited vector species and the virus during this crucial period.

The study is entitled ""The rise of West Nile Virus in Southern and Southeastern Europe: A spatial-temporal analysis investigating the combined effects of climate, land use and economic changes"". And it has been published in the academic journal One Health. (Source: UAB)

0SP7DLSKQD,Bornavirus in Germany: Infected in East Germany - What is bornavirus?,"Bornavirus in Germany: Infected in East Germany - What is bornavirus?

A woman in Saxony-Anhalt fell seriously ill after being infected with the Borna virus. The woman from the district of Anhalt-Bitterfeld has apparently been ill for months. According to the MDR, she is currently in a nursing home and is not responsive. The Robert Koch Institute also confirmed: The disease was caused by an infection with the Borna Disease Virus 1, a virus that otherwise only affects farm animals.
What is Bornavirus and how is it transmitted to humans? What are the symptoms of a disease? How dangerous is the virus? Where have there been other cases in humans so far? Bornavirus in humans: how is it transmitted? Borna Disease Virus 1 is a so-called zoonosis, i.e. a disease that is transmitted from animals to humans. According to RKI, the virus is transmitted by the field shrew. The shrew carries the virus with it for life without getting sick. Horses, sheep and other farm animals come into contact with infected mice or their feces and urine when eating, causing them to absorb the virus. How the transmission to humans works is still the subject of current research, but there are several assumptions. ""It is most likely that humans will also become infected through contact with excretions of shrews,"" writes the RKI. Direct contact with the field mouse does not seem to be necessary – which indicates that the viruses remain infectious in the environment for a long time. Infection routes can be:Contaminated food/waterInhale the virus through contaminated dustContact or bite of a shrewOther animals may also play a role, e.B cats that hunt shrews. Cats can also become infected with the Bornavirus, but only a few cases are known.
""Human-to-human transmission is very unlikely. Animals other than shrews are also considered non-infectious for animals and humans,"" according to the RKI. Symptoms of Bornavirus: headache, fever – fatal courseThe patients who were proven to be ill with the Bornavirus suffered from the following symptoms:HeadacheFant feverbeat, fatigueNeurological abnormalities: speech disorders, problems with walking, disorientationBehincter inflammationFurther course: ComaIn most known cases, the course was fatal in humans. The incubation period ranges from weeks to months – in the current case in Saxony-Anhalt, the person concerned has been showing symptoms since January 2020.
In 2017, a person in Brandenburg died of the virus. The current case in Saxony-Anhalt is the third confirmed case north of Bavaria after a case in Thuringia, where most cases have been registered so far. Between 2017 and 2019, there were two cases annually. Overall, there has been a double-digit number of infections in Germany so far. All age groups and both sexes were affected. Those affected usually live in rural areas.Infection with the Bornavirus: How to prevent the disease? According to the RKI, it is not entirely clear what the chains of infection of the current cases are. It is assumed that contact with the shrew rarely happens and therefore the disease is rarely spread among humans. Potential risks include outdoor work and activities, e.B: in agriculture and forestry. In addition, the RKI recommends: 
Do not keep shrews as petsDon't touch dead and live shrews with your bare handsIn an existing population of shrews: Withdraw food source so that no contact can occur

How to recognize a shrew? Shrews have much sharper noses or faces than real mice. Eyes and ears are relatively small. In addition, they have a pungent smell. Shrews are very rare, according to RKI. Distribution and habitat of the field shrewThe distribution area of the field shrew includes Central and Southeastern Europe as well as southwestern Asia. The animals inhabit forest-free habitats such as fallow land, grassland, roadsides, fields and gardens from the lowlands to about 700 meters altitude. They switch to more coverty and humid terrain at certain times of the year. Especially in the area of the northern distribution limit, the species is closely tied to human settlements; so it is much more common in Poland in larger cities than in small towns and villages. Otherwise, houses are mainly visited for wintering.",https://www.lr-online.de/nachrichten/brandenburg/borna-virus-bornavirus-symptome-krankeit-infektion-maus-spitzmaus-gefahr-toedlich-beim-menschen-sachsen-anhalt-thueringen-bayern-60141897.html,EN,DE,2022-05-05 04:15:03,2021-10-14 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),Outbreak declaration (m)

ByOlaf KubasikschließenWhile the highly dangerous Asian tiger mosquito slowly spreads in Heilbronn, its nasty doppelgänger is already increasingly there. Tropical diseases in Germany? Impossible! But what used to be valid has long since ceased to exist. Because the vectors of tropical viruses do not stop at borders. On the contrary: As so-called neozoa, the treacherous mosquitoes have long since become native to us - also in Heilbronn. And this includes the asian bush mosquito, which is highly dangerous on paper and is spreading rapidly in Germany. Because it is extremely adaptable, its eggs and larvae are resistant to cold. The Asian bush mosquito is considered extremely aggressive. AND: Their bites are much more painful than those of the native mosquito species. But this is by no means the worst thing about the insect, which was first detected in Germany in 2008 and is considered a doppelgänger of the deadly Asian tiger mosquito. Laboratory tests have shown that the Asian bush mosquito can be a potential carrier of numerous tropical viruses that cause severe brain inflammation (encephalitis) in humans - like some tick bites. Asian bush mosquito: Looks like tiger mosquito, is even more dangerousThe first mosquito-borne infection with West Nile virus as a trigger of meningo-encephalitis in humans was first detected in Germany in 2019 - as the Robert Koch Institute reports. It says: ""The affected patient is a 70-year-old man with a rural place of residence and work in Saxony, without prior travel abroad and without significant pre-existing conditions."" Which mosquito species acted as a vector is not sufficiently known. Could it have been an Asian bush mosquito that, like the Asian tiger mosquito, has long since reached the Heilbronn area? The Asian bush mosquito can transmit viruses, but has not yet appeared in Germany as a carrier of dangerous tropical diseases. KABS biologist Thomas Weitzel Thomas Weitzel Thomas Weitzel of the Speyer-based Municipal Action Group for the Control of the Schnakenplage (KABS) ruled out the possibility that an Asian bush mosquito was responsible for the transmission of the West Nile virus to 70-year-old Saxony. On echo24.de request, the biologist says: ""The Asian bush mosquito can transmit viruses, but has not yet appeared in Germany as a carrier of dangerous tropical diseases."" In contrast to the Asian tiger mosquito, with which it is often confused. Weitzel: ""That's why usually no measures are taken to combat them."" NameAsian or Japanese bush mosquitoFamilyStech mosquitoesGreatjapan, Korea, South ChinaFirst evidence in Baden-Württemberg2008Possible diseases after bite (laboratory tests)Encephalitis, West Nile fever, dengue, chikungunyaTiger mosquito: Doppelgänger is even more dangerous than it However, this is no guarantee to be safe from the transmission of a dangerous tropical disease by the Asian bush mosquito. Because: The warmer it gets in Germany, the better the conditions are that the viruses multiply in mosquitoes. Therefore, it is important to counteract the constantly growing population of the Asian bush mosquito in the breeding typical places in your own garden (see info box) as with the tiger mosquito. Especially clove oil has established itself as an effective natural remedy against the cold-resistant egg larvae. Reproduction of the Asian bush mosquitoIn a project work of the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Center, it is said that females of the Asian bush mosquito lay individual eggs at the level of the waterline after reproduction and a blood meal. In tree hollows or rock washouts, but also in flower vases, rain barrels or car tires. The number of their eggs varies between three and 249 per female.

What distinguishes epidemic, pandemic and endemic? EpidemicIn an epidemic, certain infectious diseases occur in a specific region over a limited period of time. The GRC explains: ""In the event of an epidemic, a contagious disease quickly spreads regionally and leads to an above-average number of patients. These are usually infectious diseases that are transmitted by a virus or bacteria. But fungi, parasites and contaminated water or food can also lead to an epidemic."" PandemicA pandemic is when an epidemic spreads across national borders, entire continents or even globally. They are usually caused by newly emerging pathogens or virus types, which may have jumped from animals to humans, for example. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global spread of Covid-19 a pandemic. Due to the lack of immunity to these new pathogens, many people fall ill. How severe depends on the virus and the general condition of those infected. Loading... EmbedEndemieRein medically, this refers to a condition in which a certain disease occurs regularly in some regions. The GRC commented: ""Endemics are regionally more frequent diseases with recurrent outbreaks that occur in a large part of the population living in the region."" The number of sufferers is higher than in other regions, but remains relatively constant. So about the same number of people get sick in a certain period of time. In May 2020, the WHO said it expected the coronavirus to become an endemic virus as well. Similar to the flu virus, it mutates and adapts again and again. What does a transition to endemic mean? It becomes clear that even if SARS-CoV-2 were to become endemic at some point, it would not be out of the world and would continue to lead to illness and death. Back in September, British infectiologist and director of the Wellcome Trust, Jeremy Farrar, said: ""We need to change our mindset about ending the pandemic as we enter a new phase of endemics with different effects in different parts of the world, largely driven by unfair access to the tools we need and interventions. To see the end of the pandemic is premature."" The burden of a virus becoming endemic also depends on protective measures and the strength of the healthcare system. It may therefore be quite conceivable that the AHA+L rules will also accompany us in the coming winters. What role does Omikron play? It is widely discussed that the new variant could lead to generally milder disease courses and thus make the virus more harmless. The epidemiologist Hajo Zeeb from the Leibniz Institute for Prevention Research in Bremen explained on Wednesday in the editorial network Germany: ""I currently assume that with Omikron we can take the step into the endemic faster.""",https://www.t-online.de/gesundheit/krankheiten-symptome/id_91399868/corona-wann-die-pandemie-enden-koennte-ist-omikron-der-anfang-.html,EN,DE,2022-05-10 15:48:44,2021-12-31 07:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),Other (m)

For the third year in a row, cases of mosquito-borne West Nile virus have been reported in Germany. In August, infections with the virus were diagnosed in Berlin for the first time this year, as the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced today.
Since July, infected birds and horses have been reported in some of the regions already affected in previous years in Berlin, Brandenburg, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia.
The RKI expects further infections in the coming weeks, especially in the affected areas in eastern Germany ""and perhaps also in new areas"". However, the risk of infection decreases due to the end of the mosquito season.
In the past two years, infections with West Nile virus have been diagnosed for the first time in humans, which were probably due to mosquito transmission. Before 2019, individual cases were repeatedly registered in Germany among travellers from regions affected by West Nile fever.
The first human case diagnosed in Germany without a travel background in 2018 involved a veterinarian who was believed to have been infected during the section of a bird who died of the virus.
The virus is transmitted mainly by mosquitoes of the genus Culex, which are widespread in Germany. The further spread in this country could therefore be favored above all by longer summers with high temperatures.
West Nile virus originates from Africa. The pathogens are transmitted by mosquitoes between birds. But mammals, especially horses, and humans can also be infected by mosquito bites.
Infections in humans are about 80 percent without symptoms, in the remaining fifth with mostly mild symptoms such as fever or rash.
Only less than one percent of all those affected experience meningitis or, more rarely, inflammation of the brain, a so-called encephalitis, which can be fatal. Vaccines or a specific therapy for humans do not yet exist. © afp/aerzteblatt.de",https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/127165/Erste-Faelle-von-West-Nil-Virus-in-Deutschland-in-diesem-Jahr,EN,DE,2022-05-05 04:15:03,2021-09-09 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

Glasgow – Infections with SARS-CoV-2 could be more severe or fatal for some people because a protein that already detects the entry of viruses at the cell membrane and enables rapid defense is defective. In bats, this defect could be possible, according to a study in Science (2021; DOI: 10.1126/science.abj3624) paradoxically explain why the animals have become an important reservoir for coronaviruses.
Cells are not defenseless against viruses. Their most important weapon is interferons, which ""interfere"" with the viruses. A prerequisite for a successful defense is that the invading viruses are detected in good time. Among the ""guardians"" is the enzyme OSA1, which recognizes viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 (but also west Nile virus or hepatitis C virus) by their double-stranded RNA (which is not normally found in the cell). OSA1 then activates ribonuclease L, which destroys the RNA and thus prevents replication.
OSA1 is located on the inside of the cell membrane (and also on the membranes of the cell organelles). The anchoring takes place with a so-called prenyl group. This anchor seems to be defective in some people. A team led by Arthur Wickenhagen from the University of Glasgow can show that the non-prenylated variant of OSA1 leads to severe courses in the case of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The likelihood of having to be treated in an intensive care unit or dying from COVID-19 was increased by 57% in a group of 499 patients (odds ratio 1.57; 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 2.25). In cell experiments, the differences were even clearer. When the prenyl group lacked OSA1, cells were 100 times more likely to go under.
Interestingly, the gene variant ""rs10774671"", which provides prenylation, is spread internationally in different ways. In many African countries, the proportion of the population is sometimes over 60%, in Europe only 30% have the gene variant ""rs10774671"", in East Asia it is even less.
The different prevalence could explain why the pandemic in Africa has been milder so far (this hypothesis, however, contradicts the increased rate of illness among African-Americans in the US). By the way, previous studies have shown that ""rs10774671"" is one of the variants that Homo sapiens has taken over from Homo neandertalensis.
The researchers were also able to show that horseshoe noses (Rhinolophidae), unlike most other animals, do not have prenylated OSA1. This could explain why they are an important reservoir for coronaviruses. The viruses could multiply unhindered in this group of bats. Why the viruses do not kill the animals, however, remains a mystery. © rme/aerzteblatt.de",https://www.aerzteblatt.de/nachrichten/127745/SARS-CoV-2-Defekter-Sensor-in-den-Zellen-erhoeht-Risiko-auf-schwere-Verlaeufe,EN,DE,2022-05-05 04:15:03,2021-09-29 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

A reduction of the West Nile virus is only possible if mosquitoes are decimated, said tropical researcher Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit in the Dlf (picture-alliance / Uwe Anspach)

Christiane Knoll: Four weeks after the first case in Germany, the West Nile virus has now also appeared in Rostock. A blackbird died from it. Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit is a tropical physician at the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg and he now says: We should slowly consider whether we will not have to test blood preserves for West Nile and the related Usustu virus in the future. Why he comes to this conclusion, I had explained to me this morning. Mr Schmidt-Chanasit, perhaps you will first bring us up to date. What is the current situation, how many birds have died of West Nile virus where?
Jonas Schmidt-Chanasit: Currently, we have been able to provide evidence for ten birds and one horse. In particular, the eastern federal states are affected, i.e. Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, Brandenburg, Thuringia have not yet been affected. And there is also evidence in Bavaria, in the vicinity of Munich - that is the current status.
""Many mosquitoes carry the virus""
Knoll: So that would be all of East Germany, southeast Germany, up to the north. But there are only eight birds and a horse, that's not much. And yet you say we should test blood products for the virus in the future. Why?
Schmidt-Chanasit: Yes, the spread, the spread in almost all eastern federal states as well as in Bavaria suggests that there is a high infection pressure. This means that a large number of mosquitoes have to carry the virus. As a result, of course, there is the possibility that a whole series of people have also been infected with the virus, and we want to prevent these people who become infected with this virus from naturally donating blood, that should not happen.
Knoll: How dangerous is West Nile virus for humans?
Schmidt-Chanasit: Actually, it's not that dangerous, because 80 percent of those infected don't even notice that they are infected. That is, they get no symptoms, only a small proportion, so 20 percent fall ill with a relatively mild symptomatology, that is, fever, rash, malaise. Of these 20 percent, it is only a very small proportion, about one percent, who then really get these severe courses, which can then also end fatally, as we are seeing in southern Europe just this year. So, one percent of those infected have these severe courses, which can be accompanied by brain inflammation.
In particular, older people are affected by these severe courses, who usually have a pre-existing condition. So they are particularly vulnerable. Or even immunosuppressed people, and of course we come back to blood donations. Who gets these blood transfusions, which are often also seriously ill patients.
""Unfortunately, we are missing the big picture""
Knoll: This means that few people are probably affected, but they may have fatal consequences. What is the probability that a blood product is really infected with the virus? You can only find very, very few birds and yet you say the virus is probably very widespread. Can you briefly explain that to us again?
Schmidt-Chanasit: Of course, that's always just the tip of the iceberg that we see. There is no comprehensive monitoring in Germany. This year, when we can catch a large number of mosquitoes, examine them, and this is not the case with birds either. We are dependent on the submissions of private individuals who find a dead blackbird, another dead bird in the garden or the dead birds that have been conspicuous in the zoos. These are only, I say, individual finds.
That is, the big picture, which we unfortunately lack, but the geographical spread from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to Saxony alone is proof that it is not a singular event, a single contribution, but that the virus was introduced several times, in different ways, to East Germany and even to Bavaria. That it must of course have already multiplied massively on site, otherwise it would not be possible for caged birds to become infected in the zoological gardens.
""It is not possible to push back the virus""
Knoll: Before we prepare for this new virus, is there anything we can do to push back the West Nile virus?
Schmidt-Chanasit: No. Pushing back the virus is just not possible. There is a vaccine for animals, so of course you can protect the horses. Not for humans, it's also not",https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/west-nil-virus-in-deutschland-es-ist-nicht-moeglich-das-100.html,EN,DE,2022-05-05 04:15:03,2021-11-13 08:50:42+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

West Nile virus detected in two horses

Image: imago
In the Dahme-Spreewald district, further cases of West Nile virus have occurred. Two horses are affected. The veterinary office calls on horse owners to have their animals vaccinated. People should also protect themselves from mosquitoes as vectors. By Iris Wussmann. 

In the district of Dahme-Spreewald, an infection with the West Nile virus was officially confirmed in two other horses. These are cases in the towns of Luckau and Schönefeld. One animal died within two days. The other had to be killed in a veterinary clinic. Already at the end of August, the animal disease had been detected in a horse in Märkisch-Buchholz.
Investigations have so far revealed no connection between the individual cases, according to the veterinary office.

Infection also in humans
The virus was detected for the first time in Germany in 2018, and the new federal states were particularly affected by illnesses. The veterinary office did not give reasons for this. Most horses would not show any signs of illness after infection. However, paralysis and muscle tremors are also possible, in severe cases the disease is fatal.
The virus is spread via mosquitoes to birds as the main hosts. Through infected mosquitoes, the virus can also be transmitted to humans and horses. However, infected people or horses are not a source of the virus themselves, so they cannot infect other people or animals, according to a statement from the county.

Call for vaccination
In humans, the infections would be predominantly inconspicuous. According to the Robert Koch Institute [rki.de], feverish, flu-like and, in severe cases, neurological diseases could occur in 20 percent of cases. According to the RKI, about five to ten percent of patients, especially the elderly and patients with a cardiovascular pre-existing condition or immunosuppression, die in severe cases that also affect the brain.
Because the mosquitoes are currently very active, the veterinary office advises mosquito repellent. This also applies to horses. These should also be vaccinated against West Nile virus. As a result, the disease proceeds with less severe symptoms. There is no vaccination for humans.
Further information on the animal disease has been compiled by the Friedrich Löffler Institute. [fli.de]

Berlin/Greifswald - The Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) in Greifswald continues to warn of the West Nile virus. It is currently spreading in Berlin and eastern Germany. ""By mid-September, 26 West Nile virus cases had been detected in wild and zoo birds. Furthermore, nine infections have been detected in horses so far, one of which had to be euthanized due to severe neurological symptoms,"" writes the FLI in a message.

Five cases were registered in the SouthObak District, two each in Belgrade, the SouthBanate and Srem districts, and one each in the Sеvеrnоbаnаtsкоm and Srеdnjеbаnаtsкоm district.
Since 2012, 1,032 people have been registered as a result of the Zаpаdnоg Nilа virus in 2020, and 98 people have died as a result of the disease.
Based on a report by the Department of Biocides and Medical Ecology of September 6th, the presence of the genome of West Nile virus was detected in domestic mosquitoes and the location on the territory of Pancevo, Novi Sad and Belgrade, as well as at the Location Of Palić.
The West Nile virus transmission season in Serbia usually lasts from June to November. Most of those infected do not have any symptoms, while in a smaller part of the infected symptoms resemble a flu-like illness.
In individual individuals, however, there is the formation of aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, or neuroinvasive form of the disease, which requires hospitalization.

The number of confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection transmitted by mosquitoes continues to rise, although the mosquito season is fading. According to the latest report by the Institute of Public Health of Serbia ""Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut"" since the last report a week ago, this fever has been confirmed in two other people, so there are now a total of 17 this season.
- Based on data submitted to the Institute and laboratory criteria on the territory of the Republic of Serbia, until 7 December 2015, October 2021. In 2014, 17 confirmed cases of West Nile fever were registered. The diseases are registered in persons from the territories of the North Banat district - one case, Midbanatsky, where there is also one case, in South Banat there are two, in Sremska - three, in Belgrade four, and in the South Backa district six cases of infection - according to the Report ""Batuta"".
The presence of this virus has so far been detected in domestic culex pipens mosquitoes in Pancevo, Novi Sad and Belgrade, as well as on the territory of Palić.
The virus has also been detected in wild birds in the South And South Banat districts.

By 23 June, by 23 June, the country's police had been in a state of A total of 107 cases of West Nile fever have been reported in the European Union and European Economic Union countries, including Greece (48), Italy (36), Romania (seven), Spain (five), Hungary (five), Austria (three) and Germany (three). During the same period, seven deaths linked to West Nile fever were registered in EU states in Greece (five), Spain (1) and Romania (one).
West Nile, by the way, is transmitted to humans by our homemade, kuleks pipiens mosquito. Last year, 2020. For the first time in 8 years, no cases of this fever have been reported in people in Serbia, although infected mosquitoes have been present in 11 cities, and although this fever in Europe has been confirmed in 308 people.
The infection was officially first registered with citizens in Serbia at the end of July 2012. Year. Since 2012. Until 2019. A total of 1,016 cases of infection and 98 deaths were registered in our country, according to official data from the Batut Institute.
It's a viral disease transmitted by the sting of an infected mosquito. Most infected people, 80%, have no symptoms or signs of the disease. In a lower percentage of infected persons, about 20%, symptoms resemble flu, with a sudden appearance of elevated body temperature, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, mild transient rash and lymphatic (enlarged lymph nodes).

In some individuals, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, or neuroinvious form of the disease, occurs, requiring hospitalization. They have headaches, stiff neck, stupor (bluntness), disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis. Long-term consequences such as fatigue, memory loss, difficulty walking, muscle weakness and depression often occur after infection.
Mortality is higher in older adults, especially in people over the age of 75.
Fortunately, the West Nile virus is not transmitted through human contact, but it can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, transplants from mother to child and breastfeeding. A person can only be infected if they have been bit by an infected mosquito, and symptoms of the disease occur in three to 14 days after the sting.
Recommendations of the Batut Institute for Mosquito Protection

- use repellents on detected body parts during outdoor stay
- wear long-sleeved clothing and leggings, bright colors. It's best to keep it comfortable, because mosquitoes can sting through tame clothing.
- Avoid outdoor stays during the most intense mosquito activity – at dusk and dawn
- use mosquito nets on windows, doors and around the bed

- if possible, stay in air-conditioned areas, the number of insects in such conditions has been significantly reduced
- avoid areas with large numbers of insects, such as forests and wetlands
- at least once a week drain the water from flower pots, food containers and water for pets, from bins, barrels and cans
- remove discarded tires and other items that may collect water

According to international media, the Marburg virus disease has been transmitted to humans by bats, which feed on fruit, and among humans, the disease spreads through bodily fluids. Experts say it is a severe and often deadly disease that causes fever and bleeding. Who's Africa Director Dr. Mashido Moeti points out that the virus has the potential to ""spread far and wide.""
So far, four high-risk contacts have been found, with 146 at risk. Reminders of the epidemic and sporadic cases of the disease in Africa have so far been registered in Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda.  The first outbreak in 1967. In 2005, it claimed seven lives, but during an outbreak in Angola in 2005, more than 100,000 people were killed. More than 200 people died in 2014.

Ebola control systems, established in Guinea and neighbouring countries, have proven crucial to an urgent response to the Marburg virus. Otherwise, the illness begins abruptly, with high fever, severe headache and malaise. Many patients develop severe hemorrhagic signs within seven days.

The presence of West Nile virus, Usutu virus, Dengue fever virus, Chikingunya (Chikingunja) virus, or Rifta Valley Fever virus, has not been established in mosquito samples collected on Montenegrin territory, the Institute of Public Health (IJZCG) said.
The results of the trials, they say, correlate with cases of the disease in the human population that have not been present this season.
""Global climate change has the greatest impact on vector infectious diseases – diseases transmitted and spread by other organisms (vectors) – most often mosquitoes, ticks and various types of heads – arthropods because the number, activity and distribution of vectors directly depends on external temperature and climatic factors, so that many vector diseases are no longer typical and limited exclusively to tropical areas"",  said Dr Nebojsa Sekulic, a specialist epidemiologist.

In the last two decades, the world has seen an increase in vector diseases, but also their intensive geographical spread, and so it is believed that currently more than half of the world's population is at risk of suffering from vector diseases, and in the total number of diseases from infectious diseases in the world, about 17 percent belong to vector infectious diseases,  of which the majority are people with malaria, in the underdeveloped countries of the African continent.

""However, the increasing frequency, prevalence, but also complexity of the spread of vector diseases with the absence of effective medicines and vaccines for many of them, emphasize the vital importance of social mobilisation, cross-sectoral cooperation and an integrated approach,"" Sekulic added.
It is for this reason, he said, through the ERI-Heath Project, that the ""Аvnzdrаzdrаšеnа sprеmnоst zа еpidеmе and the current situation was carried out, which the Institute of Public Health of Montenegro conducts with its partners, the sampling of mosquitoes on the territory of Montenegro during June, July, September and October of this year.

One of the goals of the project activities was the identification of mosquitoes that are present in our area and the viruses that these mosquitoes carry, which can cause various infectious diseases in humans.
""Samples of mosquitoes collected in a part of the southern territory of Montenegro were sent to the Scientific Veterinary Institute 'Novi Sad' in a frozen state on dry ice. The transport of mosquito samples was carried out according to all the necessary requirements and did not in any case compromise the eligibility and quality of the test samples. In total, 80 samples were delivered containing from one to 61 mosquitoes in the owls, namely 41 samples of Culex sp mosquitoes. and 39 samples of mosquitoes of the species Aedes sp., sampled on the territory of Montenegro in different periods of time in the part of the southern territory of the country (Radanovići, Radovići, Krtole, Meljine, Herceg-Novi),"" Sekulic said.
The obtained findings, he said, indicate that in the 2021 season either there was no circulation of the virus in the investigational areas (localities) or this circulation was at a very low level, so it was not detected by examining the submitted number of samples and individuals of mosquitoes.
""The information obtained after the analysis will be used to improve the control of vector diseases, as well as to control mosquitoes as vectors, prepare education in the field of prevention of these diseases, as well as raise awareness of the dangers of these infectious diseases, and take on protection measures in the program area.

West Nile disease is caused by West Nile virus, which in nature is maintained in a cycle between mosquitoes and birds that are the primary reservoirs of the virus.
The virus can infect humans, birds, mosquitoes, horses and other mammals, according to an explanation published by the Belgrade Institute of Public Health.
The basic way of transmitting infection to humans and other animals is to stab an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes are infected when sucking on the blood of infected birds, which are a reservoir of disease (mostly ravens and nitvilles).
The virus is not transmitted from human to human.
According to the same institute, about 80 percent of infected people experience the disease asymptomatic, and about 20 percent of those infected have a mild clinical picture in the form of fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, sometimes swelling of the lymph glands or a rash on the skin of the chest, back or stomach. In one disease per 150 infected there is development of a severe clinical picture with signs of inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis), or neuroinvavazivable form of the disease.

N4BDZNJLF0,Mosquito spraying from next week,"Mosquito spraying from next week

Mosquito spraying in Podgorica will begin next week.
The fight against this type of insect is delayed because the tender for selecting a bidder to do so was annulled, so it had to be re-called.
As ""Vijesti"" was told from the Capital ""in accordance with the established dynamics, the tender for selecting a subject to conduct spraying in the area of the capital was announced in the first quarter of the current year"".

""The tender was annulled because no correct bids were submitted. The above procedure was repeated in May, under which the Decision on choosing the most favourable offer was made. Accordingly, the spraying is scheduled to begin within the next week,"" the capital said.

""News"" several citizens complained that the number of mosquitoes in the city had increased, and they didn't notice that spraying had been done.
""On Zabjell, mosquitoes really stabbed me when I was in that part of town a few days ago,"" one fellow resident said.
She said as far as she knows mosquito spraying has not been done so far this year.
As recently reported by serbian media, the West Nile virus has been detected in five Belgrade municipalities, with the greatest danger being ""home"" mosquitoes, which are actually virus carriers.
""The laboratory of the Department of Ecology and Environmental Improvement of the JKP City Cleanliness during the analysis of mosquitoes extracted from the territory of the City of Belgrade detected the West Nile virus on the territory of palilula municipality, and the number of mosquitoes increased in the municipalities of Zemun, Grocka, Zvezdara and Vozdovac.""
According to media reports there, mosquito spraying in Belgrade has been going on for more than a month and began in June.
The biggest problem is the left bank of the Danube, where increased mosquito suppression was carried out yesterday.
The dean of the Faculty of Biology in Belgrade, Zeljko Tomanovic, has issued an appeal that especially all fellow citizens should take care of premises such as water cellars, as well as any other wet areas.
It should be explained to people, as he pointed out, that there are piles of mosquitoes in the water sources, wet basements, or if they have any moisture in the house/building.
He can't do that, he clarified no plane to suppress except the people who live there.

Mild winters and rainy, warm summers are ideal for breeding mosquitoes After three years, The West Nile virus has been re-registered in Serbia, and Belgrade authorities have urged people to avoid staying outside during the biggest activity of these insects, which is 19 to 24 hours. The West Nile virus was registered in the laboratory of the Department of Ecology and Environmental Improvement of the Public Utility Company ""City Cleanliness"" during the analysis of mosquitoes from the territory of the City of Belgrade, the company said."" We ask our fellow citizens to act responsibly, to make sure to use repellant (mosquito repellents) and nets."" The emergence of West Nile virus was expected, which is why we have entered the process of engaging the air force."" Unfortunately, our suspicions have come true, which is why I urge my fellow citizens to be vigilant and not ignore the symptoms, and to report to the doctor due to the appearance of high temperature, headache, malaise or rash in the chest area,"" said Belgrade Public-Utility Pedophilia Director Marko Popadic.Three years ago (2018)  and more than 28 have been infected with West Nile virus, according to official data. Since 2012. Until 2017. In 2014, 574 people were diagnosed with West Nile virus in Serbia, 61 of whom died, according to the Institute of Public Health of Serbia ""Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut"". The West Nile virus is now the most prevalent in the world in the category of insect bites. The JKP City Cleanliness appealed to people not to disturb their mosquito-borne workers, which had happened in the previous days and weeks in some parts of Belgrade.Some workers were attacked and insulted because some accused them of ""spraying the corona"". I hope that fellow citizens understand that any disruption to mosquito suppression actions puts the health of all Belgraders at risk,"" Popadic warned.What is the West Nile virus? West Nile virus is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. A mosquito can become infected after biting an infected bird. There is no evidence to suggest that the virus can be transmitted from one person to another or from other kinds of animals to humans. Symptoms of the disease occur up to two weeks after the sting of an infected mosquito."" For about 80% of infected persons, this disease flows without symptoms,"" according to experts at the Institute of Public Health of Serbia."" About 20% of those infected have a mild clinical picture in the form of fever, headache, nausea and vomiting."" Symptoms of the virus usually pass within days, but there are cases when they can last several weeks. The most sensitive group are people over 50 and chronic illnesses. On average, for every 150 patients, complications occur in one person.
The virus is carried by birds, and is transmitted to humans by a bite from an infected mosquito. The West Nile virus was first identified in Uganda in 1937. Year. More recently, outbreaks have also erupted in North America, Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe.The first case in Serbia was recorded in 2012. In 2013, a 60-year-old woman died. In 2018,"" he said. In 2014, ten diseases were registered in Belgrade and south Banat district, six in South Backa, two in the Sremska district and one in the Danube district. What's with the West Nile virus in Serbia? One of the main causes of the West Nile virus outbreak in Serbia is climate change that has led to the reproduction of mosquitoes in Serbia.The Institute of Public Health of Serbia has included this virus among the five that pose a threat to the health of the population due to climate change. Mild winters and rainy, warm summers like this are ideal for breeding mosquitoes.
Scientists have begun the first trials of a vaccine against West Nile virus. There is no specific protection against West Nile fever. In 2015, they began developing a vaccine against the virus, and in 2015, they began developing a vaccine against the virus. the first vaccine trials on infected people have begun in the UK. Professor Chris Curtis, of the Medical Entomology At the London School of Hygiene, said people should not worry about the virus, ""but it's certainly good to be aware of it."" Over a period of several decades, enough people will have this virus and recover to become immune to it,"" Dr Tony Fauci of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told the BBC.  ekologija@gradskacistoca.rs.The easiest ways to prevent disease are actually to prevent mosquito bites:
Wearing clothes that cover your arms and legs
Mosquito destruction

Mosquitoes infected with the West Nile virus, which has already claimed two human lives in our country this summer, have been detected in four locations in Serbia.

According to media reports at the top of the health system, near Belgrade, where infected mosquitoes were first detected, West Nile fever was detected in bloodsuckers in Pancevo, Pozarevac and Stara Pazova.Over the weekend, according to the Institute of Public Health of Serbia ""Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut"", and on the official report the presence of the Virus of The Nile is found in the I'm going to have to deal with a six-year-old girl in the state of Pancevo and two others on the  the tyranny of the beethoven.
In Belgrade, let's remember, the West Nile virus was confirmed in early July, and last week two deaths were reported in people linked to this fever in Serbia. The Institute of Public Health of Serbia ""Dr Milan Jovanovic Batut"" tells Telegraf.rs that apart from the two cases, which unfortunately ended in death, there are no new diagnosed cases. West Nile fever has been confirmed in the first two cases. The disease ended in a fatal outcome for them - according to the Batut Institute for Telegraf.rs adding that there are no hospitalized patients because of the virus. Let's remember, from the consequences of this disease, one male and one female, aged 63 and 50, from South Backa and Sremska districts died. Both had associated chronic diseases.

This means that the female approaches our body without the males hanging around at all. So that means the virus is transmitted to us by a female. Ah, West Nile is transmitting our homemade, kuleks pipiens mosquito. Last year, 2020. For the first time in eight years, there have been no cases of this fever in humans, although West Nile-infected mosquitoes have been present in 11 cities, and although this fever in Europe has been confirmed in 308 people. The infection was officially first registered with citizens in Serbia at the end of July 2012. Year. Since 2012. Until 2019. A total of 1,016 cases of infection and 98 deaths were registered in our country, according to official data from the Batut Institute. It's a viral disease transmitted by the sting of an infected mosquito. Most infected people, 80%, have no symptoms or signs of the disease. In a lower percentage of infected persons, about 20%, symptoms resemble flu, with a sudden appearance of elevated body temperature, headache, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, mild transient rash and lymphatic (enlarged lymph nodes). In some individuals, aseptic meningitis or encephalitis, or neuroinvious form of the disease, occurs, requiring hospitalization. They have headaches, stiff neck, stupor (bluntness), disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis. Long-term consequences such as fatigue, memory loss, difficulty walking, muscle weakness and depression often occur after infection. Mortality is higher in older adults, especially in people over the age of 75. Fortunately, the West Nile virus is not transmitted through human contact, but it can be transmitted through blood transfusions, organ transplants, transplants from mother to child and breastfeeding. A person can only be infected if they have been bit by an infected mosquito, and symptoms of the disease occur in three to 14 days after the sting. Otherwise, the circulation of this virus has been present everywhere on the European continent since the 1960s. The Batut Institute's recommendations for mosquito protection - use repellant on exposed body parts while outdoors - wear long-sleeved clothing and leggings, bright colors. It's best to be comfortable, because mosquitoes can sting through tame clothing.- Avoid staying outdoors during the most intense mosquito activity - at dusk and dawn - use mosquito nets on windows, doors and around the bed - if possible, stay in air-conditioned areas, the number of insects in such conditions has been significantly reduced.  such as forests and wetlands- at least once a week drain the water from flower pots, Food and water containers for pets, from bins, barrels and cans- remove discarded tires and other items that can collect water, in European Union countries, in italy two and in Greece.",https://pink.rs/drustvo/322825/oprez-na-ovim-lokacijama-u-srbiji-se-nalaze-komarci-zarazeni-virusom-zapadnog-nila,EN,HR,2022-04-15 06:22:44,2021-08-11 12:10:23+00:00,Relevant (m),Other (m),

6HYVYC6END,Space exploration poses threats to space and Earth,"To the Editor:
A number of nations are in or about to go into space for a variety of reasons such as military, scientific, adventure, and tourism, in search of mineral wealth and even agriculture.
For example, it has been reported that the American company Heinz ketchup had proposed to grow tomatoes on Mars. It also has been reported that diapers would be needed by the astronauts for these long space expeditions.
Human feces can contain bacterial, fungal, and protozoan pathogens, which may find a way to reproduce in some of these foreign environments.
They will face different selective pressures causing them to change as they adapt to that environment. Some of the changes might actually make the organisms more disease causing.
In my 41 years as wildlife pathologist for the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation, part of my job was to monitor for exotic diseases coming into the state. That led me to finding a number of diseases such as the epizootic hemorrhagic disease and the West Nile virus.
However, when you consider the possibility of organisms that could be introduced from space and from Earth to space, I realize that at this time we have an even greater threat.
We should have a number of scientists in different disciplines take a look at some of the potential effects of biota introduced into space. And also, the possibility of biota already in space that can adapt to Earth, grow, and compete with organisms here on Earth.
I suggest that congressional hearings be held as quickly as possible on the potential for Earth’s existing biota to become a problem in space and vice versa.
Biota doesn’t need to be disease-causing to be a massive problem but could be invasive and outcompete the Earth species. The United States already has a lot of scientifically skilled people who should be consulted on potential threats by evolving biota from space.
These people include academic biologists and ecologists from universities, state agencies, the U.S. military medical corps and scientific personnel from the departments of the interior, health, and agriculture.
We have seen what not being prepared for COVID-19 has cost us in human mortality and it is possible that introduced organisms from space could cause bigger problems than we’ve ever seen. We have thoroughly polluted Earth and we should not follow with the pollution of space.

It was followed by salmonellosis, which affected 52,702 people compared to 88,000 in 2019. The number of reported foodborne outbreaks also fell by 47%. These findings are based on the annual EU One Health zoonosis report, by EFSA and ECDC.
Experts acknowledged the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe in the remarkable drop in reported zoonotic diseases in humans – ranging from 7% to 53% depending on the reported disease in question - and foodborne outbreaks.
Possible factors behind the large decrease in cases include changes in health seeking behaviour, restrictions on travel and on events, the closing of restaurants, quarantine, lockdown, and other mitigation measures such as the use of masks, physical distancing and hand sanitisation. 
The next most commonly reported diseases were yersiniosis (5,668) and infections caused by Shigatoxin-producing E.coli (4,446). Listeriosis was the fifth most reported zoonosis (1,876 cases), mainly affecting people over the age of 64.
Listeriosis and West Nile virus infections were the diseases with the highest case fatality and hospitalisation rates – with most locally acquired human infections of West Nile virus reported in Greece, Spain and Italy.
The report also monitors foodborne outbreaks in the EU, events during which at least two people contract the same illness from the same contaminated food. A total of 3,086 foodborne outbreaks were reported in 2020.Salmonella remained the most frequently detected agent and caused about 23% outbreaks.

C4NXS5PGMN,Russia warns of increase in cases of West Nile Virus: All you need to know,"Russia warned on Monday of a possible increase in West Nile Virus (WNV) infections this autumn as mild temperatures and heavy precipitation create favourable conditions for the mosquitos that carry it.
""In light of favourable climatic conditions this year - an abundance of precipitation... a warm and long autumn, a high number of (virus) carriers could be observed in the autumn,"" Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's consumer health watchdog, said.
More than 80% of Russia's West Nile fever cases are recorded in its southwest region.
What is West Nile Virus?
WNV is an infectious disease spread by infected mosquitoes. It spreads from birds to humans with the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. It can lead to a fatal neurological disease in humans.
The virus causes West Nile fever in around 20 per cent of cases, according to World Health Organization (WHO). It is related to the Zika, dengue and yellow fever viruses.
What are the symptoms of WNV?
People who get WNV usually have no symptoms or mild symptoms. The symptoms include a fever, headache, body aches, skin rash, and swollen lymph glands. They can last a few days to several weeks, and usually go away on their own.
Where did the WNV originate?
According to WHO, WNV was first isolated in a woman in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. It was identified in birds (crows and columbiformes) in Nile delta region in 1953.
Before 1997, WNV was not considered pathogenic for birds, but at that time in Israel a more virulent strain caused the death of different bird species presenting signs of encephalitis and paralysis. Human infections attributable to WNV have been reported in many countries for over 50 years, the WHO said.

When is it dangerous?
If West Nile virus enters the brain, it can be life-threatening. It may cause inflammation of the brain, called encephalitis, or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called meningitis.
How is WNV diagnosed?
A physical exam, medical history, and laboratory tests can diagnose it.
Who are at risk?
Older people, children and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk.
What is the cure?
There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human WNV disease. The best way to avoid WNV is to prevent mosquito bites. Treatment is supportive for patients with neuro-invasive West Nile virus, often involving hospitalization, intravenous fluids, respiratory support, and prevention of secondary infections.
Scientists have said that milder temperatures attributed to climate change could cause diseases such as the WNV to become more widespread.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-warns-of-increase-in-cases-of-west-nile-virus-all-you-need-to-know-101630322044172-amp.html,EN,,2021-09-01 06:53:30,2021-08-30 11:20:17+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

There has been one confirmed human case of WNV in Georgia, although it was not in the Coastal Health District.Camden County Mosquito Control Services has increased prevention measures in the area and is urging residents to follow the “5 Ds” of mosquito bite prevention:Dress – Wear loose-fitting, long-sleeved shirts and pants to reduce the amount of exposed skin.DEET – Cover exposed skin with an insect repellent containing the DEET, which is the most effective repellent against mosquito bites.Drain – Empty any outdoor containers holding standing water because they are breeding grounds for virus-carrying mosquitoes.Doors – Make sure doors and windows are in good repair and fit tightly and fix torn or damaged screens to keep mosquitoes out of the house.Dusk/Dawn – Avoid dusk and dawn activities during the summer when mosquitoes are most active.For more information on mosquito-borne illnesses, please visit the Coastal Health District’s website.Copyright 2021 by WJXT News4Jax - All rights reserved.",https://www.news4jax.com/news/georgia/2021/10/13/west-nile-virus-found-in-mosquitos-in-st-marys/,EN,,2021-10-22 04:28:15,2021-10-13 07:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),
K08SXNYWF0,Insect-borne viruses circulating among horses and birds in northeastern Spain,"File image.
Testing indicates that West Nile virus and Usutu virus are circulating widely among birds and horses in Catalonia, in northeastern Spain.
Tick-borne encephalitis virus was also sporadically detected in horses, Sebastian Napp and his fellow researchers reported in the journal Viruses.

Their study looked at the incidence of flaviviruses in horses and birds in the region between 2010 and 2019.
Flaviviruses include important pathogens that are capable of infecting humans, such as dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus.
Like West Nile virus, others in the genus, such as Usutu virus and Bagaza virus, can cause severe disease in animals. They are transmitted to susceptible animals through the likes of blood-feeding mosquitoes or ticks.

In recent years, the areas in Europe reporting flavivirus infections, particularly those caused by West Nile virus, Usutu virus or tick-borne encephalitis virus, have increased significantly, the authors noted.
“Many of these viruses are currently endemic in several areas of the continent.”
Of the 3791 serum samples collected from birds in Catalonia between 2010 and 2019, 380, or 10 percent, were positive for a flavivirus.
Of these, there was enough serum in 205 cases for more precise analysis. In all, 118 showed specific antibodies for West Nile virus, 19 for Usutu virus, and 68 were classified as an undetermined flavivirus. None was classified as Bagaza virus.
Of the 1856 serum samples collected from horses in the same time period, 182, or 9.8 percent, tested positive. Of them, 164 had enough serum for further testing. Ninety-two were found to be positive for West Nile virus, 11 for Usutu, four for tick-borne encephalitis virus, and 57 were classified as infected by an undetermined flavivirus.

The authors said there may have been some bias in the selection of animals for the study. In the case of birds, some species were over-represented either because they were useful for West Nile surveillance (such as chickens or magpies), were found in wildlife recovery centers (such as raptors), or because samples were commonly collected within other surveillance programs.
In horses, the distribution of samples may have been influenced by the proximity to the Equine Veterinary Hospital. Finally, some regions, mainly the areas where West Nile circulation was detected, were also over-represented as a result of the specific surveys implemented there.
The researchers noted that a third of the samples tested were inconclusive by microneutralization test in terms of identifying the specific virus, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic techniques.
“Our results evidenced the widespread circulation of flaviviruses, in particular West Nile virus, but also Usutu virus, and suggest that chicken and horses could serve as sentinels for both viruses,” they said.
They noted that, so far, no human infections by West Nile, Usutu or tick-borne encephalitis viruses have been reported in Catalonia.

“However, considering that these viruses have been circulating for some time in different areas of Catalonia means that they need to be kept under surveillance, and the most efficient way to do that is within a One Health framework.
“That includes raising awareness among medical practitioners (clinicians), to consider these infections in the differential diagnosis of patients with compatible clinical symptoms.”
Given the widespread distribution of West Nile virus and Usutu virus in Catalonia, microneutralization tests for both viruses should be included as a routine technique for the correct diagnosis of flavivirus infections. “Failure to do so results in both under-detection and misclassification,” they said.
“Considering the sporadic detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus, further studies of the risk of introduction and establishment would be needed.”

Children, older people, and those with weakened immune systems are more at risk. 

West Nile Virus treatment
There are no specific treatments or vaccines for West Nile Disease in humans. The best way to avoid infections is to prevent mosquito bites.
The treatment is supportive for the patients with neuro-invasive West Nile Virus which often involves, intravenous fluids, hospitalization, prevention of secondary infections, and respiratory support.
The milder temperatures attributed to climate change can cause diseases such as the West Nile Virus to become more widespread.",https://m.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/what-is-west-nile-virus-russia-warns-of-increase-in-cases-know-west-nile-virus-symptoms-treatment-origin-of-wnv-1630395721-1?ref%3Dlist_ca,EN,,2021-09-02 11:22:32,2021-08-31 07:43:00+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),
RBQEOKNAG6,Warming climate favors the transmission of West Nile Virus in Europe,"Increases in temperatures as a result of climate change is favoring the transmission of the West Nile Virus (WNV) in parts of Europe, by creating more suitable conditions for the virus and its mosquito vectors to proliferate.
This is the conclusion of a study by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology of the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB) that analyses the different reasons why the WNV has recently emerged as an important health concern in Europe due to its rapid spread. Scientists warn that the virus will spread to more northerly locations in Europe given a warming climate.
The West Nile Virus is a zoonotic vector-borne disease that is usually transmitted between birds and mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected, but cannot transmit the virus back to mosquitoes or other organisms. Infections in humans can be serious leading to neurological disease and death.Until recently, WNV was only occasionally reported in Europe; it was believed that the virus entered Europe through migratory birds infected with the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. However, it has recently emerged as a major public health concern in Europe given its rapid spread.
In this study, recently published in the scientific journal One Health, researchers aimed to discover the reasons why the disease has become so prevalent in Europe lately. They processed and analyzed vast quantities of data for 166 southern and southeastern European regions over a 13-year period, which captured changes in climate, land-use patterns, economic changes, and central government spending on areas like sanitation and the environment.
According to Matthew Watts, first author of the study, there is not one simple explanation to describe the recent rise of WNV, but rather a combination of causes. Generally, warmer weather in spring and summer months due to climate change is making conditions more favorable for the virus and its mosquito vectors, speeding up mosquito development and extending their breeding season which can, in turn, increase their numbers.
More importantly, warmer winters are also likely to have allowed infected female common house mosquitoes (Culex pipiens) to survive the winter in regions that were previously too cold (such as in northern Italy); therefore, the virus can now survive with mosquitoes throughout the winter and spread earlier on in the year. The results confirmed that regions with a higher proportion of wetlands and arable land, including irrigated agriculture that tends to attract susceptible birds and mosquito species, were most at risk of contracting the disease.

Shifting over to irrigated from other land-use types would have certainly increased the disease risk. Drought may also be increasing the intensity of disease outbreaks, as shrinking water resource means that mosquitoes and birds come into closer contact and therefore increase potential transmission events and hence the prevalence of the virus, which can then spill over into human populations"".
Matthew Watts, First Author

All of these environmental changes occurred during a period of austerity in many countries. Countries with the highest number of cases of WNV over the period analyzed were also those that made the biggest cuts in government infrastructure and hazard prevention spending e.g., environmental protection and wastewater spending, which could have benefited vector species and the virus during this crucial period.

Article content The Chatham-Kent public health unit reports that lab results confirm the mosquitoes collected Aug. 31 tested positive. This is the municipality’s second positive trap of the summer. West Nile virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. Many infected people have no symptoms, but some have mild symptoms, such as fever, headache, body aches and fatigue. In rare cases, infected people may have severe illness, including a stiff neck, nausea, difficulty swallowing, vomiting, and lack of co-ordination or paralysis, said the health unit. Anyone with severe symptoms should seek immediate medical attention. Older people and those with compromised immune systems are at a higher risk of severe illness. People can protect themselves by wearing light-coloured clothing, including long-sleeved shirts, long pants and socks; using insect repellent containing DEET; staying indoors from dusk to dawn when mosquitoes are most active; ensuring all door and window screens are tight and free of holes; and eliminating sources of standing water on their property to prevent mosquito breeding.",https://www.sarniathisweek.com/news/local-news/mosquitoes-in-dresden-test-positive-for-west-nile-virus-2,EN,,2021-09-08 19:41:42,2021-09-08 14:12:27+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),
3FM06TZWXR,"Nile fever, a case in the Spezzino","Cornoviglio Glass (La Spezia), July 6, 2021 - How the virus arrived in the Spezzino is still the subject of hypotheses. Certainly, however, there is that for a few days now an elderly resident of Calice al Cornoviglio has been admitted to the Sant'Andrea hospital after contracting the 'West Nile', more commonly called Nile fever, a disease transmitted mainly by mosquitoes and wild birds that in most cases occurs in asymptomatic form or with light symptoms (fever , headache, nausea, vomiting), but which in the elderly and chronic or debilitated subjects can lead to more serious symptoms, with the risk of neurological damage.
The woman, currently asymptomatic, fortunately is fine, but the case has obviously triggered the ad hoc national health protocols, which involving on the front line the Department of Prevention of Asl5, the Zooprophylactic Institute and the Municipality of Chalice in what turns out to be the first case of contagion from 'West Nile' registered this year in Italy.

""No alarm"" tends to point out the institutions, which in recent days have started all the necessary procedures not only to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon but also to avoid a possible proliferation of mosquitoes. Yes, because at the center of the story there is precisely the insect that, according to the hypotheses that filter from the sanitary environments, may have first snooted an infected migratory bird, infecting itself, and then stinging and infecting the elderly woman, thus acting as a vehicle of the virus. And if, however, the risk of a proliferation of the virus is almost nil – the vectors through which it spreads are wild birds and mosquitoes, the stings of which are the main means of transmission to humans, while it is not transmitted from person to person and there is therefore no risk if you have come into contact with an infected person – the institutions want to see us clear.
Thus, the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Piedmont, Liguria and Valle d'Aosta has launched an entomological investigation to verify the actual presence of mosquitoes infected with the virus in the Chalice, and there is also an activity of disinfestation of the areas adjacent to those of the woman's residence. Not only that. The mayor of Calice al Cornoviglio Mario Scampelli, on the recommendation of the Department of Prevention of Asl5, has issued an ordinance with a series of indications to be respected to avoid the proliferation of mosquitoes: in the text it is ordered not to abandon or deposit objects and containers where rainwater can accumulate; to empty or flip any container of water for common use, including the sub-oil-bearing sub-values; to hermetically cover water containers such as bins, tanks, storage tanks, and also to empty fountains and swimming pools not in use, or to ""perform appropriate larvicide treatments"" with dense mesh nets.

This is also a matter of blood donations. The National Blood Center in light of the infection reported on the platform for the 'Surveillance of arbovirosis' of the Higher Institute of Health, has issued a circular in which the introduction of the Nat Wnv test on blood donations and blood components collected in the province of Spezzina is arranged.

5LGY7PCDIE,Nile fever and our region,"12.08.21-07.30-After the reporting of these days in Pordenone of a case of Encephalitis caused by the Nile Virus, let's go into depth with the epidemiologist Fulvio Zorzut what it is and the real dangers that can be incurred.
West Nile Fever virus is a flavivirus found in Africa, West Asia and the Middle East. The WNf virus was isolated in 1937 in humans, birds, and other animals but until 1999 it had not been isolated in the Western Hemisphere.
In our areas, cases of the disease occur mainly in late summer or early autumn. So some cases, especially in the lagoon, can be expected at this time of year. In Italy, WN disease in horses was first identified in 1998, in Padule di Fucecchio, Tuscany, in an outbreak that caused the death of six horses in the period between August and October of that year.
The disease is contracted through the bite of infected mosquitoes which in turn become infected by feeding on the blood of infected birds, usually corvids.
It has been seen that other types of birds can also represent the natural reservoir of the virus, in addition to horses, cats, raccoons and bats. There is no evidence that you can contract the disease by handling live or dead infected birds. The disease is not transmitted from man to man and this is fundamental.
The virus multiplies at the blood level. The percentage of deaths varies between 3% and 15% of the sick and is higher in the elderly. The attack rate, however, is very low, less than 1% of infected mosquito bites result in symptomatic infection.
Incubation is 3-15 days. Most infections run inapparently. In the most serious forms, especially in elderly people and children, in addition to headache and fever, spatio-temporal disorientation, tremors, convulsions, coma appear. Immunity lasts for a lifetime.
The history of assessing the real risk of exposure to the Wnf virus is decisive.
Travel to endemic areas is certainly an element of risk even if it is now endemic even here. The diagnosis is serological and is made through the search for antibodies. Vector control is the most effective method to prevent the introduction and spread of WN, in free territories and the consequent transmission to humans and animals, vector control methods include both environmental control measures (mosquito population, disinfestation of areas adjacent to cases, hygiene rules, application of mosquito nets and chemical repellents) and behavioral prophylaxis measures to reduce the risk of  exposure to insect bite.
What, then, are the precautions that should be taken? Mainly a good promotion of individual and environmental protection measures; surveillance of human neuroinvasive cases; control over organ donations and restrictions and controls on blood donations.

84WVHI2A2P,With increasing temperatures and rains mosquitoes multiply and carry viruses that can be easily transmitted to humans,"Joao Paulo Burini via Getty ImagesThe extreme weather events of these days are not the only consequence of the climate crisis. The increase in average temperatures is responsible for the appearance of new diseases, which previously did not spread in our country because climatic conditions did not exist. An emerging example is the large group of mosquito diseases. Due to higher global average temperatures and more abundant rainfall mosquitoes are increasing around the globe. Some are vehicles of viruses that can be easily transmitted to humans. Today, half of the world's population is at risk of mosquito-borne diseases. Three typically African viruses, such as Zika, Chikungunya and West Nile Disease virus, the cause of sometimes fatal infections, are now widespread all over the globe.   Global warming triggers mosquito diseases for two reasons. The first is that it allows tropical mosquitoes, excellent vectors of viruses dangerous to humans, to survive very well in our latitudes. Thanks to the import of the most varied commercial products, from ornamental plants to car tires, every year unpublished species of mosquitoes land in new territories. Once arrived in our country, exotic mosquitoes find a new climate, favorable to their survival and replication. The finding of Korean mosquitoes in our country, for example, is now usual. The second reason is that extreme heat waves are intensifying the reproductive cycle of local mosquitoes, reducing the interval between one oviposition and another. The numerical invasion becomes massive and is not only more cause of annoyances but of a serious threat to health. An example is West Nile Disease. The infection can be trivial, symptom-free or flu-like, but in the elderly and immunocompromised it can evolve into a potentially fatal encephalitis. The person responsible is a Flavivirus that keeps its cycle vital thanks to mosquitoes and some wild city birds, such as magpies and crows. Even the horse, like man, if slipt from an infected mosquito gets sick with encephalitis. The disease appeared in Italy for the first time in 2008, then it spread and two years ago our country was among the most affected in the world, with over 500 people affected. A few days ago in the province of La Spezia the first case of this year was registered. In eight Italian regions there are provinces considered to be at high risk for west nile. It is essential that viral circulation in mosquitoes and animals is checked, because these become infected a month before humans and can function as sentinels. The Zooprophylactic Institutes analyze mosquitoes collected in traps that simulate the breath of a warm-blooded animal and that are placed in strategic areas. This action is cheap and allows you to have an early response capacity, useful for making health decisions aimed at containing the disease, such as the interruption of blood donations in a territory that has registered positivity.",https://www.huffingtonpost.it/entry/con-laumento-di-temperature-e-piogge-le-zanzare-si-moltiplicano-e-portano-virus-trasmissibili-con-facilita-alluomo_it_60f7d71be4b0e92dfebde8b6,EN,IT,2021-07-23 14:06:50,2021-07-21 08:40:03+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),General information (m)

There would already be 25 cases of Nile fever (West Nile Virus infection) in the Italian territory since last June: of these 5 are in Lombardy, of which 4 in the province of Mantua and one in the province of Pavia, two in hospital including an 80-year-old resident of Porto Mantovano (in serious condition, but now stable). The surveillance bulletin of the Istituto superiore di Sanità (updated a few days ago) has published a first mapping: out of 24 cases reported on September 2, 15 would have occurred in a neuro-invasive form (in Liguria, Emilia Romagna, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Lombardy and Veneto) and 9 cases identified in blood donors (in Emilia Romagna and Lombardy). The first case was reported by Liguria in June: to date no deaths among the reported cases. The Lombard infected in recent weeks are between 45 and 64 years old and over 75 years old.
Nile fever
Nile fever, also known as West Nile Fever, is a disease caused by west nile virus (Wnv), a virus of the Flaviviridae family isolated for the first time in 1937 in Uganda, precisely in the West Nile district, from which it takes its name: today it is widespread in Afria, Western Asia, Europe, Australia and America. The reservoirs of the virus are wild birds and especially mosquitoes, more frequently of the Culex type, whose bites are the main means of transmission to humans. West Nile fever, remember, is not transmitted from person to person through contact with infected people.
Symptoms and risks
The incubation period, from the moment of the bite of an infected mosquito, varies from 2 to 14 days, but can also be three weeks in subjects with a deficit of the immune system. Most infected people do not show any symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, about 20% have mild symptoms: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, enlarged lymph nodes, skin rashes. These symptoms can last a few days, in rare cases a few weeks.
In children a light fever is more frequent, in young people the symptomatology is characterized by medium high fever, red eyes, headaches, muscle pain: in the elderly and in debilitated people, however, the symptomatology may be more serious. The most severe symptoms occur on average in less than 1% of infected people (one in 150): borderline cases (about one in 1,000) can also lead to death, from encephalitis.",https://www.bresciatoday.it/attualita/febbre-nilo-2021.html,EN,IT,2021-09-09 18:21:31,2021-09-09 07:59:45+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),Outbreak declaration (m)
9KLSKYZVEV,"Mosquitoes in Alexandria positive for The West Nile Virus, here are the areas to avoid","ALEXANDRIA – As part of the fight against mosquitoes in place in the Municipality of Alessandria, the Institute for Wood Plants and the Environment has announced that the mosquito sample collected between 27 and 28 July, has tested positive for the West Nile Virus. The station of the traps is the one located at the beginning of the stretch of the old Carlo Alberto canal near the cemetery and the headquarters of Amag Ambiente, in viale Michel 44.
The Technical And Scientific Referent of the Ipla-Alessandria operations center, Dr. Asghar Talbalaghi, has announced that extraordinary adulticide treatments have already been activated and will be carried out in the area between Viale Milite ignoto, the airport area and up to that of the heliport (First Aid-Argini Area). Specifically, all the green spots included in this area will be treated with particular attention to those adjacent to the Carlo Alberto canal and the Amag Ambiente headquarters. 

The administration has therefore invited the population to limit the attendance of these areas by citizens who usually, in the cooler hours of the day, often carry out sports activities wearing clothes that do not prevent mosquito bites or, in any case, it is advisable to take all possible precautions to avoid unpleasant contacts with this species of insects. ""The situation is monitored and, without creating alarmism - assures the Councilor for the Environment and Policies for Environmental Sustainability, Paolo Borasio -, all the extraordinary measures provided for the treatments are put in place"".
The story had already been raised this Sunday by the president of the City Council Emanuele Locci who, on his Facebook profile, had given advice to all Alexandrians: ""Do not frequent the area towards the banks after the cemetery where many go to run or, if by necessity you should go to that area, do it taking all the necessary precautions to avoid mosquito bites.

9XC0TVT3NS,test on 80 chickens from three farms between Manfredonia and San Giovanni Rotondo,"Following a report from citizens, on November 28 the veterinarians of the ASL Foggia intervened to recover and hospitalize, at an appropriate facility, a specimen of gray heron found suffering in Piazza delle viole in Manfredonia.
After about two days of treatment, the specimen died and its carcass was transferred to the Foggia headquarters of the Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute of Puglia and Basilicata. The veterinarians of the Simple Diagnostic Structure performed the autopsy (necropsy) finding anatomical-pathological lesions compatible with infection with avian influenza virus. As a result, some organs of the heron (brain, lung and intestine) were taken to the Simple Structure of Virology that on December 9 found in the organs the avian influenza virus, subtype H5N1 (AIV H5N1) through RT RT-PCR test.
As current legislation requires, on December 10, the organs found positive were delivered, by internal courier, to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie which is the national reference center of avian influenza and which has the task of confirming the laboratory diagnosis of the territorial IIZZSS and determining the pathogenicity index of the virus. The Istituto delle Venezie immediately confirmed the laboratory diagnosis, through rt rt-pcr, and determined the virus as ""highly pathogenic"" (AIV H5N1 HPAI).
In the following days, as required by law, the regional crisis unit ordered clinical and diagnostic checks (PCR) on tracheal swabs present in all domestic, family and commercial poultry farms, located within the 'Restriction Zone', determined with a radius of 10 km starting from the point of discovery of the heron. Passive surveillance activity on wild birds within this area has also been intensified.
To date, 80 samples taken from chickens belonging to three farms (one farm in San Giovanni Rotondo and two in Manfredonia) have been checked. All tests were negative for avian influenza virus, says Nicola Cavaliere, veterinary doctor responsible for the Simple Virology Structure, Izspb Foggia.
In Italy, surveillance plans have been active for some time with the aim of detecting early the introduction of viruses normally not present in the territory. This activity is carried out through the veterinary services of the AASSLL which, as part of a series of actions, intervene to recover carcasses of wild birds found dead or sick for subsequent forwarding to experimental zooprophylactic institutes that provide molecular biology tests (RT Real-Time PCR) to detect the presence of the West Nile Disease virus,  usutu virus and avian influenza viruses (passive surveillance).

ASDV9VAAYF,The Japanese mosquito has arrived in Italy: more resistant than the tiger mosquito,"It bears a strong resemblance to the better-known tiger mosquito, but usually comes with larger sizes. Among its characteristics, that of feeding on human blood, stinging even during daylight hours, proving to be particularly aggressive and harassing.

Mosquito bites, five natural remedies against itching

The fear of the experts, now that it seems to spread in an important way, ""is that from the eastern area of Northern Italy will move to the western part"", underlined to the newspaper ""La Repubblica"" the veterinarian Annapaola Rizzoli. As a result, there is also a fear that the presence of the Japanese mosquito may contribute to the transmission of some diseases typical of these insects, such as Dengue, Chikungunya and West Nile. Without forgetting ""japanese headache"", of which, however, at the moment, no cases have been found in Europe. ""For the virus to be transmitted it is necessary that there are the insect, the virus and the exact same environment in which this transmission is possible, typically that of Southeast Asia"", reported Fabrizio Montarsi, head of the parasitology laboratory of the Zooprophylactic Institute of Padua.
Precautions to avoid spreading
The spread of this insect, Rizzoli pointed out, is also confirmed by its characteristics, underlined by scientific research. ""It is the third most invasive species in the world among mosquitoes and is in the top hundred of all the most invasive ones,"" she said. And the success of his invasion is also explained by the fact that he was able to demonstrate significant resistance to long distances and ""the ability to develop into a series of natural and artificial containers in which there is stagnation of water"". Precisely for this reason, according to experts, it is necessary to adopt a whole series of precautions to prevent the Japanese mosquito from continuing to spread. Among them, ""do not leave open the containers that can be filled with water, do not stack materials, use mosquito nets, empty and turn watering cans upside down, keep the areas where you live clean"", continued the veterinarian. However, insecticides and larvicide interventions proposed on a regular basis should not be underestimated, without forgetting sterilization strategies, especially aimed at male insects, which during the mating period do not allow to make females fertile. Upstream of everything, the scholars explained, it is urgent to apply a capillary monitoring method, to better understand where these mosquitoes have settled and in which environments they prefer to stay.",https://tg24.sky.it/salute-e-benessere/2021/09/27/zanzara-giapponese-italia,EN,IT,2021-09-30 05:05:18,2021-09-27 08:22:49+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

And so, now that the vaccination campaign proceeds quickly and the summer allows you to spend more time outdoors, we end up being almost surprised by mosquito bites. Annoying, especially if in large numbers, these insects rarely pose a threat to health. However, in some cases, mosquitoes can act as a vector and spread viral diseases with serious consequences such as dengue - it is news these days of a case in Bologna - and above all the West Nile fever, the so-called West Nile, which has now become endemic in Northern Italy.

""In Italy there are more than sixty of the 3,500 species of mosquito that exist. However, there are few that create concern for human health"", said entomologist Marco Pombi, researcher in Parasitology at the Department of Public Health and Infectious Diseases of Sapienza University of Rome. The list of special observed includes, in addition to local mosquitoes such as the common one (Culex pipiens) and that of the rice fields (Aedes caspius), also exotic species now established in our country such as the tiger mosquito (A. albopictus), the Japanese one (A. japonicus) or the Korean one (A. koreicus).
West Nile is particularly widespread in Emilia-Romagna and Veneto and is mainly transmitted by the common mosquito: mostly asymptomatic, in about a fifth of cases the infection causes fever, with symptoms similar to those of the flu that disappear after a few days. However, in about one case every two hundred, West Nile can manifest itself in a neuroinvasive form with potentially fatal consequences, especially among the elderly.
In our country dengue can instead be transmitted by the tiger mosquito and is known as ""split fever"" for the intense bone and muscle pain that it can cause when it is symptomatic. The chance of getting sick is low, but not as remote as exotic names would suggest.

""Despite the limitations of travel, even last summer we recorded a small outbreak of dengue in the province of Treviso, triggered by a person who had contracted the virus abroad"", resumes the entomologist, underlining how in our country the contagion has so far always started from people and not from infected mosquitoes. The surveillance of vectors is complex and articulated: entomologists, infectivologists and veterinarians work side by side to promptly identify possible outbreaks and prevent the risk of transmission.
Containment strategies
Attempts to contain mosquito populations vary according to the context - urban or rural - and the approach used. ""The most common one is chemical and involves the periodic sprinkling of larvicides in the spring with the aim of reducing the densities of adults in the following months. If this strategy is not successful, towards the end of the summer insecticides such as pyrethroids can be used to eliminate adults"", continues Pombi.
However, this is an extreme move: first of all, as is the case with antibiotics with bacteria, exposure to pyrethroids triggers resistance phenomena among mosquitoes and therefore in the long run reduce the effectiveness of the treatment. Secondly, being broad-spectrum insecticides, pyrethroids are lethal even for valuable insects such as bees and bumblebees. For this reason, when possible, we try to prefer biological remedies such as the introduction of fish, such as gambusia, which feed on mosquito larvae in ponds and ponds.
More refined strategies, but which so far sin in persistence or rapidity, involve the dispersion of certain bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis) that produce toxins specific to mosquitoes or spores of fungi that feed on them. The last way is through genetic modification, as evidenced by the large-scale project launched last month in the United States to contain the yellow fever mosquito (Aedes aegypti).

Bacterial infection
Even in Italy, however, something is moving: in recent weeks the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie has launched a pilot project to control the tiger mosquito through the release of sterilized males. The project was developed by the research company Biovecblok, a spin-off of the University of Camerino, which started the experimentation in the municipalities of Arzignano (Vicenza) and Occhiobello (Rovigo).
The protocol involves the release of male individuals of common mosquito rendered sterile by the infection of the Wolbachia bacterium. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) considers it a non-GMO technique that meets the safety criteria. Mosquito males do not sting, therefore they do not bring any discomfort and do not pose any threat to humans. In addition, Wolbachia is a bacterium in",https://www.repubblica.it/salute/2021/07/19/news/zanzare_italia-310557940/,EN,IT,2021-07-19 22:02:22,2021-07-19 10:27:31+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),
DW2C9DGWUH,"West Nile, the virus transmitted by mosquitoes: a 75-year-old man hospitalized in Modena","In Modena, a 75-year-old man is hospitalized for West Nile virus infection but his condition is improving. The Nile virus from mosquito bite had recorded in 2020 57 cases of contagion and 4 deaths. Now the health authorities of Modena invite citizens not to lower their guard and to protect themselves from infection. Hospitalized for West Nile, improving conditions In Modena a 75-year-old man is hospitalized due to a West Nile virus infection in the Neurology department, at the Ramazzini hospital in Carpi. To communicate it is the Ausl of Modena. The condition of the elderly is improving. The same Ausl of Modena invites not to lower the guard against mosquitoes, to counteract the spread of viruses related to the proliferation of this insect, just like West Nile. In particular, the common mosquito (culex pipiens), in addition to being particularly annoying, can be a carrier of infections. Until now, only one confirmed case of West Nile Virus infection, manifested in the neuro-invasive form, had been reported in Italy in Liguria. The Italian case was the first reported case in Europe. According to the west Nile integrated surveillance bulletin, edited by the ISS Department of Infectious Diseases.   Covid vaccine: «Triggers a superimmunity and rejects all the variants in those who contracted Sars years ago» The cases in 2020 According to ISS data since the beginning of June 2020, 57 confirmed human cases of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection had been reported in Italy, of these 39 have manifested themselves in the neuro-invasive form (28 in Lombardy,  5 in Emilia-Romagna, 4 in Piedmont, 2 in Veneto), 5 cases as confirmed fever, 13 cases identified in blood donors. Among the cases, 4 deaths have been reported (1 in Piedmont, 1 in Emilia-Romagna and 2 in Lombardy). In the same period, the first case of Usutu virus was reported in Veneto in the neuroinvasive form.  Covid, two deaths in 24 hours. And meanwhile the ASL brings vaccines to the beach The West Nile virus It is since 1937 that West Nile fever is known, a disease caused by the West Nile Virus (Wnv), a virus of the Flaviviridae family isolated for the first time in that year in Uganda, precisely in the West Nile district (from which it takes its name). The virus - it is written on the epicentro website, a portal of epidemiology for public health - is widespread in Africa, Western Asia, Europe, Australia and America. Incubation and symptoms The incubation period from the moment of the bite of the infected mosquito varies between 2 and 14 days, but can also be 21 days in subjects with deficits in the immune system. Most infected people do not show any symptoms. Among the symptomatic cases, about 20% have mild symptoms: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, enlarged lymph nodes, skin rashes. These symptoms can last a few days, in rare cases a few weeks, and can vary greatly depending on the age of the person. In children a mild fever is more frequent, in young people the symptomatology is characterized by medium high fever, redness of the eyes, headache and muscle pain. In the elderly and debilitated people, on the other hand, the symptoms may be more severe. The most severe symptoms occur on average in less than 1% of infected people (1 in 150 people), and include high fever, severe headaches, muscle weakness, disorientation, tremors, visual disturbances, numbness, seizures, up to paralysis and coma. Some neurological effects may be permanent. In severe cases (about 1 in a thousand) the virus can cause lethal encephalitis.     Diagnosis The diagnosis is mainly made through laboratory tests (Elisa or Immunofluorescence) carried out on serum and, where indicated, on cerebrospinal fluid, for the search for antibodies of the IgM type. These antibodies can persist for very long periods in sick subjects (up to a year), so the positivity to these tests can also indicate a previous infection. Samples collected within 8 days of the onset of symptoms may be negative, so it is advisable to repeat the laboratory test after some time before excluding the disease. Alternatively, diagnosis can also be made through PCR or viral culture on serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples. Prevention There is no vaccine for West Nile fever. Vaccines are currently being studied, but for the moment prevention consists mainly in reducing exposure to mosquito bites. Therefore it is advisable to protect yourself from bites and prevent mosquitoes from reproducing easily: using repellents and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk using mosquito nets on the windows frequently emptying the pots ",https://www.ilmattino.it/primopiano/cronaca/west_nile_virus_zanzare_uomo_ricoverato_modena-6146334.html,EN,IT,2022-03-13 19:37:33,2021-08-19 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

Fear for West Nile returns. The Bassa is confirmed as an endemic territory. The Ats, in fact, has identified, with the traps for catching mosquitoes, positioned in the territory of Caselle Landi, positive insects. On the other hand, human cases of contagion have not been found, according to the Ats. The Ats plan provides for the early detection of the circulation of viruses on the territory during the season of activity of the vectors, testing mosquitoes, birds, horses and humans, in order to reduce the risk of transmission to the latter. From the beginning of June 2020 to December of the same year, in Italy, 68 human cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported, of these 45 manifested themselves in the neuro-invasive form, 7 cases as confirmed fever, 16 cases identified in blood donors. Among the cases, 5 deaths were reported. The Bassa has been identified as an endemic territory. When positive mosquitoes emerge from the sample, the asst transfusion center starts the monitoring campaign on donors. ""The organization is on a provincial basis - explains the doctor Giuseppe Cambiè - and with references to the neighboring province if the cases are reported between the two municipalities. On all donors, the molecular test for the virus is carried out together with the other tests that are normally performed on each donation. In addition to the tests for hepatitis and HIV, there is also the search for the West Nile virus genome. So far, no donors have tested positive.

EPQZJ7X84O,"Modena, West Nile Virus, two other men hospitalized","Modena, West Nile Virus, two other men hospitalized They are 84 and 85 years old, meanwhile the 75-year-old who was in hospital in Carpi has been discharged. The Ausl recommends doing preventionMODENA. Two other cases of West Nile, the disease that in Italy is transmitted mainly by the common mosquito, although it is possible that the infection occurs after the bite of the tiger mosquito. The circulation of West Nile was detected already in July through monitoring with entomological traps, with the detection of the presence of the virus in different capture sites, both in the North and Central Area. And to confirm the danger of the infection, which in most cases does not involve any symptoms, while in less than 1% cases it causes serious disorders of the central nervous system, such as encephalitis or meningitis, there are two citizens of Modena (aged 85 and 84, one of the two from Castelnuovo) hospitalized for West Nile Disease, while a third (the 75-year-old hospitalized at the Ramazzini Hospital in Carpi) was discharged in recent days. West Nile, two other cases: how to defend yourselfTwo recommendations come from the Ausl: avoid being sricked and put in place environmental prevention measures to counteract the proliferation of insects. These are the two fundamental rules that every citizen is called to follow in terms of mosquitoes, vectors of viruses, such as West Nile, Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue, which can also lead to even more serious pathologies. It should also be clarified that the disease is not transmitted from man to man. The current environmental conditions, with the alternation of sun and rain and the presence of high humidity rates, are well suited for the proliferation of these insects, including the common mosquito (culex pipiens) very active at dusk in this season. For this reason, the USL Company renews its appeal to citizens, called to do their part both by carrying out larvicide treatments in the green areas of relevance, and by protecting themselves from stings using repellents and mosquito nets. Meanwhile, initiatives continue on the territory to combat the spread of mosquitoes, especially in the most ""sensitive"" environments. In this regard, for two years the project ""Adopt a School"", conceived by the Local Health Authority of Modena, has been active in several municipalities of the province: a team game to urge citizens to carry out larvicide treatments and to take care of vegetable gardens and gardens, to limit as much as possible the spread of infections transmitted by mosquitoes. The aim is to create ""buffer"" zones in areas where there are kindergartens, kindergartens and primary schools, to protect children and their families, especially grandparents. In fact, these are the categories most affected by the annoyances and risks of mosquito bites and other insects, such as parrots. In these areas, residents are invited, also through door-to-door interventions, to regularly carry out the larvicide treatments necessary to limit their proliferation and to pay attention to water stagnation.© REPRODUCTION RESERVED",https://gazzettadimodena.gelocal.it/modena/cronaca/2021/09/01/news/virus-west-nile-altri-due-uomini-ricoverati-1.40653325,EN,IT,2021-09-02 11:37:38,2021-09-01 09:04:17+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

On Tuesday 17 Treviso and Verona had joined the other territories after the positivity in the municipalities of Ponte di Piave, Erbè and Nogarole Rocca.In the previous days the CNS had extended the measures also to the provinces of Gorizia and Pordenone: in the latter case, the positivity to the virus was found in a human case. On Friday, August 6, the CNS issued two circulars. The first, in the late morning, to announce that the measures had been taken in the provinces of Cremona and Parma following the ""positive finding in a pool of mosquitoes in the municipality of Zibello and, in a talking trap, right in the Cremona area"". Recall that the talking trap is the tool with which the Higher Institute of Health collects mosquitoes throughout the national territory to understand if they are infected or not. They are called ""speakers"" because they are positioned in border areas and therefore able to communicate the presence of the virus to multiple geographical areas.

GJ15EC4NP7,"Aids: Cns, for 25 years no transfusion infections, safe system","Rome, 29 Nov. (Adnkronos Health) - ""Blood transfusion is a safe procedure and for over 25 years it has not recorded cases of HIV infection"". This is confirmed by the 2020 data released in view of World AIDS Day, which will be celebrated on December 1st. As reported by the National Blood Center (CNS) in the 'Italian Blood System 2020' report, in fact, there have been no cases of HIV infections in the over 2.8 million transfusions recorded in the past year, given that it is also confirmed in the first months of the current year.
The last case of HIV transmitted through a transfusion - reads a note from the CNS - always dates back to 1995 and since then, thanks to the introduction of increasingly precise 'Nat Tests', which have made it possible to reduce the so-called 'window period', and to the system based on a pre-donation questionnaire that highlights any risky behaviors, the possibility of contracting HIV through a transfusion has been reduced to a probability that,  from a scientific point of view, it is considered negligible. According to a study carried out by the Istituto superiore di sanità and the Department of Biomedical Sciences for Health of the University of Milan, in 2019 the residual risk of contracting HIV from a transfusion passed, in the decade 2009/2018, from 1 unit in 1.2 million to 1 unit in 45 million. Hypothesis therefore much more remote than that, to give an example, that an airplane falls.
""The Nat tests, to which all the bags of blood collected are subjected, allowed last year to identify 64 HIV positives in the donor population, with a prevalence of 9 cases per 100,000 for donors at the first donation and with an incidence of 1.9 cases per 100,000 for regular donors. The question of information on risky behaviour remains a sore point. Of the 55% of the reported cases, for which it was possible to identify exposure to a risk factor, most denied or admitted that they did not know that such behavior represented a risk,"" the statement reads.
""The safety of blood, of the patients who receive it and of the donors who donate it – commented the director of the CNS Vincenzo De Angelis – has always been at the center of the efforts of the entire blood system. The evolution of medical technology and the implementation of increasingly stringent protocols have meant that the risks of HIV infections related to transfusions are a bad memory of a past that will never return.""
The first guarantee of blood safety, in Italy, derives from the choice to make the donation a voluntary, free and anonymous act and that the vast majority of donors perform periodically, another pillar of security. By not donating 'for someone' in particular and since there is no form of reward, we prevent people with motivations other than altruism from showing up to donate. Before the donation you must then fill out a questionnaire, containing questions aimed at deepening any risk behavior of the donor, previous diseases and ongoing therapies, and undergo a visit with the doctor expert in the selection of blood donors.
The outcome of the completion of the questionnaire and the visit will determine the suitability or not of the donor. All bags of donated blood are then tested for the Hbv, Hcv, HIV and Treponema viruses responsible for syphilis. At particular times of the year, these tests may be joined by further tests to look for other viruses such as West Nile Virus. Donations are used only if the results of the tests carried out are all negative.

West Nile disease or West Nile fever, from an epidemiological point of view, is the most important viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes in Italy. The virus is transmitted to humans and animals, by means of the mosquito bite of the genus Culex, which mainly affects wild birds (mostly passerines and corvids), through which the virus can circulate and maintain itself in the environment.

One of the new laboratories is highly bioconting (safety level 3 out of 4), where the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other emerging viruses such as West Nile, native to Africa but present for years in some areas of Italy, and the dengue and chikungunya viruses, endemic in tropical regions, but which have already caused epidemic outbreaks also in the West because they can be transmitted by the ""tiger mosquito"". On the surveillance of these viruses, the Negrar Center has been actively collaborating for over 10 years with the Veneto Region, and will now be able to carry out advanced research also in the laboratory. Another area of research will be on mycobacteria, which cause very serious diseases, including tuberculosis and leprosy. The IRCCS will also be enriched with prestigious consultancies from the Spallanzani Institute in Rome: professors Maria Rosaria Capobianchi and Antonino Di Caro, both virologists.

Despite the media attention on Covid, even in 2021 there are again cases of this tenor, even if far from being epidemic outbreaks.
The last example is three cases of legionella in Friuli Venezia Giulia; two of these required hospitalization, while the third presented in mild form. One of the three cases was of a man returning from a trip. Legionella, a virus isolated for the first time in the USA, is formed in aquatic environments; from there it spreads in the pipes and infects by aerosol, that is, by air. It usually prefers to nest in air conditioning systems, especially if the necessary checks are not carried out.
Last year there was even a mini outbreak of legionella in Aviano.
This year there are no cases of viruses transmitted by mosquitoes; the best known is the West Nile Virus, but there is usually no shortage of Dengue and Usutu.
Three years ago, in 2018, there were multiple cases and one death, thanks to the scorching summer that had favored the proliferation of mosquitoes. This year delicate areas in this sense are Liguria and Emilia-Romagna.

West Nile Fever is a disease caused by the Wnv virus. This virus is part of the Flaviviridae family and was first isolated in 1937 in Uganda. Mosquitoes are the main means of transmission to humans of the virus to humans, but there are also other ways in which a man can be infected. There are cases, albeit rare, of contagion through organ transplants, blood transfusions and mother-to-fetus transmission in pregnancy. 
The West Nile Virus is not transmitted from person to person through contact with infected people.
The incubation period from the moment of the bite of the infected mosquito varies between 2 and 14 days, but can also be 21 days in subjects with immune system deficiency. Most infected people do not show any symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, about 20% have mild symptoms: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, enlarged lymph nodes, skin rashes. In children a light fever is more frequent, in young people the symptomatology is characterized by medium-high fever, redness of the eyes, headache and muscle pain. In the elderly and debilitated people, however, the symptomatology may be more severe.

MANTUA. A patient infected with West Nile Virus was registered in the province of Mantua. This is the first case in 2021: the ""Nile fever"" hit a sixty-year-old woman from Borgofranco sul Po. The patient has no obvious symptoms and her health condition, continuously monitored, does not cause concern. The vector that transmits the infection is not the tiger mosquito, but our common nocturnal mosquito (Culex pipiens). Although the sixty-year-old mantuan is practically asymptomatic, the health bodies have managed to identify her as an Avis donor. Every year, in fact, sentinel traps for mosquitoes are also placed in Lombardy and both in Mantua and cremonese in a pool of insects captured and analyzed the presence of the virus has been found. At that point, the screening protocol on blood donors was immediately triggered. And from the checks on the blood bags we went back to the infected woman who will now have to wait a certain period before returning to donate. Since June 2021, the beginning of seasonal surveillance, at the end of July the first human case of West Nile Virus infection manifested in a neuro-invasive form had been reported in Liguria. The case had been confirmed in the province of La Spezia. And also since the beginning of June, according to when reported by the bulletin of August 12 of the Higher Institute of Health, 6 confirmed cases of Infection with West Nile Virus have been reported in Italy. Of these 4 have manifested themselves in the neuro-invasive form (1 in Liguria, 2 in Emilia Romagna and 1 in Friuli Venezia Giulia) and 2 cases identified in blood donors (both in Emilia-Romagna). West Nile fever is caused by a virus that has birds and mosquitoes as reservoirs, whose bites are the main means of transmission to humans. Most infected people do not show any symptoms. Among symptomatic cases, about 20% have mild symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, skin rashes. The most severe symptoms occur on average in less than 1% of infected people, usually elderly or debilitated subjects, and include high fever, severe headaches, muscle weakness, disorientation, tremors, visual impairment, numbness, convulsions, up to paralysis and coma. In Italy, the epidemiological surveillance of human cases of West Nile virus disease is regulated by the national plan of prevention, surveillance and response to Arbovirosis 2020-2025, and coordinated by the ISS and the Ministry of Health.

L14N58QANA,"Japanese mosquito alarm in Italy: it is more resistant than the ""tiger"" and can transmit deadly diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya and West Nile","It is Japanese mosquito alarm in Italy. The dreaded insect, more resistant and aggressive than the already known ""tiger"" mosquito has been spotted in the North-East, in particular in Friuli. It feeds on human blood, stings even during daylight hours and can transmit potentially deadly diseases such as Dengue, Chikungunya and West Nile but also ""Japanese headache"". Not only that, it also has a strong adaptive capacity, which is why its presence has been found in both urban and wooded environments.
The fear of the experts ""is that from the eastern area of Northern Italy it will move to the western part"", as the veterinarian Annapaola Rizzoli explained to the newspaper Repubblica. ""It is the third most invasive species in the world among mosquitoes and is in the top hundred of all the most invasive ones,"" she said. And the success of his invasion is also explained by the fact that he was able to demonstrate significant resistance to long distances and ""the ability to develop into a series of natural and artificial containers in which there is stagnation of water"". The attention is all focused on the fact that this insect can bring potentially deadly diseases: ""For the virus to be transmitted it is necessary that there are the insect, the virus and the exact same environment in which this transmission is possible, typically that of Southeast Asia"", added Fabrizio Montarsi, head of the parasitology laboratory of the Zooprophylactic Institute of Padua.
Precisely for this reason, according to experts, it is necessary to immediately begin to adopt a whole series of precautions to prevent the Japanese mosquito from continuing to spread. Among these, ""do not leave open the containers that can be filled with water, do not stack materials, use mosquito nets, empty and turn the watering cans upside down, keep the areas where you live clean"", continued Annapaola Rizzoli. It is therefore necessary to prepare a monitoring plan for the spread of this insect and the start of a massive disinfestation campaign, before it can spread irrevocably on our territory.

""Donating is fundamental and always serves"" is the appeal that comes from Avis Trentino. At the moment our Province is perfectly able to respond to the internal needs of blood and, as has already happened in the past, it also manages to help other territories.  However, the attention remains very high because to influence donations, especially in this period, is often the low propensity of donors who are on vacation but also the increase in the areas affected by the West Nile Virus with consequent restrictions on withdrawals to people who have stayed there. It is news of these days, in fact, that cases of West Nile Virus have been detected in the province of Brescia and therefore the prevention measures have been taken with the temporary suspension for 28 days of blood and blood component donors who have stayed even for one night in the areas shown in the table.

LRRGZUOLJX,"Nile fever, serious an elderly man from Porto Mantovano. He is hospitalized at Poma","MANTOVA – An 80-year-old elderly man from Porto Mantovano is hospitalized in serious condition at the Carlo Poma hospital in Mantua due to the infection of Nile fever (West Nile Virus). This is the third case ascertained in the province of Mantua this summer, certainly the one that has had the most serious consequences.
The elderly, after days with a fever due to meningocephalitis, now seems to be recording slight improvements and doctors are in fact relatively optimistic that the worst is behind him. The fever has also dropped in recent days.
The two previous cases were less serious, with the infection that had affected two sixty-year-olds respectively of Borgofranco sul Po and Poggio Rusco, although both had ended up in the hospital.
Nile fever is a viral disease that mainly affects birds transmitted by mosquitoes.  Mosquitoes become infected by biting birds and sometimes transmit the virus even to accidental hosts such as horses and humans. The mosquito that transmits West Nile virus (WNV) is not the tiger mosquito, but our common nocturnal mosquito (Culex pipiens) that stings from dusk to dawn.
The incubation period from the moment of the bite of the infected mosquito varies between 2 and 14 days, but can also be 21 days in subjects with a deficit of the immune system.
Most infected people do not show any symptoms. Among the symptomatic cases, about 20% have mild symptoms: fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, enlarged lymph nodes, skin rashes. These symptoms can last a few days, in rare cases a few weeks, and can vary greatly depending on the age of the person. In children a mild fever is more frequent, in young people the symptomatology is characterized by medium high fever, redness of the eyes, headache and muscle pain. In the elderly and debilitated people, on the other hand, the symptoms may be more severe.
Symptoms
The most severe symptoms occur on average in less than 1% of infected people (1 in 150 people), and include high fever, severe headaches, muscle weakness, disorientation, tremors, visual disturbances, numbness, seizures, up to paralysis and coma. Some neurological effects may be permanent. In severe cases (about 1 in a thousand) the virus can cause lethal encephalitis.
Diagnosis
The diagnosis is mainly made through laboratory tests (Elisa or Immunofluorescence) carried out on serum and, where indicated, on cerebrospinal fluid, for the search for antibodies of the IgM type. These antibodies can persist for very long periods in sick subjects (up to a year), so the positivity to these tests can also indicate a previous infection. Samples collected within 8 days of the onset of symptoms may be negative, so it is advisable to repeat the laboratory test after some time before excluding the disease. Alternatively, diagnosis can also be made through PCR or viral culture on serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples.
Prevention
There is no vaccine for West Nile fever. Vaccines are currently being studied, but for the moment prevention consists mainly in reducing exposure to mosquito bites.
Therefore it is advisable to protect yourself from bites and prevent mosquitoes from reproducing easily:

using repellents and wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts when outdoors, especially at sunrise and sunset
using mosquito nets on the windows
frequently emptying flower pots or other containers (e.g. buckets) with stagnant water
often changing the water in bowls for animals
keeping the paddling pools for children upright when not in use.

Therapy and treatment
There is no specific therapy for West Nile fever. In most cases, the symptoms disappear on their own after a few days or may last for a few weeks. In severe cases, hospitalization is necessary, where the treatments administered include intravenous fluids and assisted breathing.",https://mantovauno.it/cronaca/febbre-del-nilo-grave-un-anziano-di-porto-mantovano-e-ricoverato-al-poma/,EN,IT,2021-09-09 18:21:31,2021-08-31 08:53:57+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

OPEEHKZBEH,Nile fever in Friuli Venezia Giulia,"And 'these days the report, in Pordenone, of a case of Encephalitis caused by the Nile Virus and the information acquired do not result in recent trips to exotic areas. The West Nile Fever virus is a flavivirus that is found in Africa, In Western Asia and in the Middle East, explains in Dr. Fulvio Zorzut former director of SC Hygiene Public Health ASS Triestina, Epidemiologist, Specialist in Hygiene and Preventive Medicine who in a note wanted to clarify the actual risks to avoid alarmism. The WNf virus was isolated in 1937 in humans, birds, and other animals but until 1999 it had not been isolated in the Western Hemisphere. In our areas, cases of the disease occur mainly in late summer or early autumn. So some cases, especially in the lagoon, can be expected at this time of year. In Italy, WN disease in horses was first identified in 1998, in Padule di Fucecchio, Tuscany, in an outbreak that caused the death of six horses in the period between August and October of that year. The disease is contracted through the bite of infected mosquitoes which in turn become infected by feeding on the blood of infected birds, usually corvids. It has been seen that other types of birds can also represent the natural reservoir of the virus, in addition to horses, cats, raccoons and bats.
There is no evidence that you can contract the disease by handling live or dead infected birds. The disease is not transmitted from man to man and this is fundamental.
The virus multiplies at the blood level. The percentage of deaths varies between 3% and 15% of the sick and is higher in the elderly.
The attack rate is very low, less than 1% of infected mosquito bites result in symptomatic infection
Incubation is 3-15 days. Most infections run inapparently. In the most serious forms, especially in elderly people and children, in addition to headache and fever, spatio-temporal disorientation, trembling convulsions, coma appear. Immunity lasts for a lifetime.
The history of assessing the real risk of exposure to the Wnf virus is decisive. Travel to endemic areas is certainly an element of risk even if it is now endemic even here. The diagnosis is serological and is made through the search for antibodies.
Vector control is the most effective method to prevent the introduction and spread of WN, in free territories and the consequent transmission to humans and animals, Vector control methods include both environmental control measures (mosquito population, disinfestation of areas adjacent to cases, hygiene rules, application of mosquito nets and chemical repellents) and behavioral prophylaxis measures to reduce the risk of  exposure to insect bite

OXSKWK4UN0,"Sos Avian, what is happening: from outbreaks in farms to public health alarms, measures in the field","From Ostia to Ferrara, from Verona to Padua. Bird flu returns to occupy the scene after invading some farms. And with the news the alarm grows: what is happening? The Ministry of Health, with a note yesterday, November 10, announces that additional positivity for influenza virus subtype H5N1 with high pathogenicity (HPAI) has been found in 20 poultry farms in Italy, with particular reference to Veronese. The latest wave of alarm, however, started from the gates of Rome, from Ostia Antica, where the outbreak emerged from checks carried out for an abnormal mortality in a non-commercial poultry farm. A case of virus was thus detected from the bird samples. The health problem is carried along with the debate on how to manage farms and on the direct repercussions, beyond the specific cases of avian, on the health of human beings. Rome, bird flu in Ostia: ""Death 50 chickens"". It is alarm on the coast The avian in Ostia, tight on the farms: and a ""red zone"" is triggered What is the pathology: origin and spread Meanwhile, however, a question: what is avian influenza? The name comes from ""avis"", bird in Latin. It is a highly contagious disease, particularly widespread, linked to the action of an influenza virus of strain A (orthomyxovirus), which affects different species of wild and domestic birds, with symptoms that can be inadrent or mild (low pathogenic viruses), or severe and systemic with involvement of the respiratory, digestive and nervous systems and high mortality (highly pathogenic virus). According to laboratory and clinical evidence, documented and recognized by the scientific community in 1997, the virus can be transmitted to humans. It was first identified in Piedmont in 1878. The relationship between animal species and humans This in theory. Hence the alarms. However, empirical evidence also says something else and somewhat alleviates concerns. ""We have never had human cases of avian influenza in Italy so far, fortunately,"" explained Guido Grilli, professor of Avian Pathology at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Milan. Meanwhile, ""it is not easy for this virus to affect humans,"" he explained in an interview with Adnkronos Health. There have been small outbreaks particularly in Southeast Asia, ""but not in our country. We are also less exposed to the different kind of life we do: we do not sleep with animals and we have specialized farms: those who have turkeys have only those, those who have broilers have only those ». The problem of the passage of species, and of a possible jump to man, specifies the expert, is linked to the fact that the virus can be modified only if there is a passage in another animal. ""We have very few receptors for the avian influenza virus and we only have them in the lungs. Therefore the virus must be breathed in large quantities and be able to reach directly into the alveoli, because if it stops earlier it does not take root». Ultimately, Grilli observes, today ""West Nile is much more dangerous and causes more deaths"". Incidentally, West Nile is a disease caused by a virus of the Flaviviridae family first isolated in 1937 in Uganda. Wild birds and mosquitoes are vectors. The invitation to prudence Let's go back to the alarms in Italy for avian. The last SOS starts from some outbreaks in Veronese: the surveillance zone has also been extended to some farms in the Bassa Padovana. Coldiretti Padova invites companies to pay the utmost attention and to immediately report any suspicious symptoms.  The presence of an outbreak in Minerbe also involves a small portion of the Paduan territory, between the municipalities of Montagnana and Urbana, where the surveillance zone is established in which four farm farms and four others family-run farms fall. The situation is under control and Coldiretti Padova, recalling that ""the safety standards of our farms are very high"", recommends the importance of the correct application of biosecurity measures in a constant and meticulous manner. ""We must put in place all the necessary countermeasures to keep the virus away from our companies"", recalls the president of Coldiretti Padova Massimo Bressan. ""We invite all breeders to respect individual protocols to avoid the risk of indirect contagion."" On the territory there are 303 poultry farms, with over 5.3 million heads. The safety specification In the surveillance zone - this is the safety specification applied after the detection of an outbreak - the movement of poultry and also the transport to slaughterhouses or the introduction of new animals are prohibited, the vehicles entering and leaving must be disinfected and dedicated footwear and clothing must be used on the farm.

WQCOSQL9SX,"West Nile fever: symptoms and when it arises. ""That's why cases are growing""","A transfusion

Pisa, 15 October 2021 - The area of infection is concentrated, for now, in the areas where the mosquito, carrier of the virus, lives in the North, but Tuscany is also monitored. The West Nile virus risk (first isolated in 1937 in Uganda, in the West Nile district) arrives every summer (first case of 2021 in La Spezia) and lasts until October-November. The monitoring also concerns donors in Pisa. The virus is found in wild birds and mosquitoes. But it can be transmitted (rarer) through transplants, blood transfusions and in pregnancy mother-fetus. It is Prof. Marco Falcone of Infectious Diseases to make the point.
Professor, how is the situation in Pisa? ""Since 2016 there has been a veterinary surveillance system (animal and entomological) essential for risk estimation. This surveillance and that of human cases are in the same Integrated National Surveillance and Response Plan. In 2017 in Tuscany there were 2 cases of infection. Since the beginning of June 2021, however, 36 confirmed cases have been recorded in Italy. No one for now in Tuscany"". Do you think it will come here too? ""It is difficult at the moment to make predictions. There has been a surveillance system for several years now. I do not think that today it can constitute a health problem that must worry us but certainly needs careful surveillance "". What are the symptoms? ""Most infections start completely asymptomatic; about 20% of subjects develop mild febrile illness, after an incubation of 2-14 days, characterized by nausea, vomiting, headache, asthenia and skin rash. In less than 1% of cases the disease manifests itself in a neuro-invasive form (usually encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or flaccid paralysis) with symptoms such as high fever, intense headache, disorientation, tremors, visual disturbances, numbness, convulsions, up to paralysis and coma. In 1 in 1000 cases, encephalitis can be lethal. In a third of cases, neurological sequelae can occur a few years later."" How to prevent? ""Unfortunately, there is no vaccine. However, it is possible to protect oneself from mosquito bites."" In recent years, cases are growing, why? ""Basically for two reasons. The first is related to climate change that perhaps favors the spread of vectors. The second to the surveillance and notification system that have been implemented"".

X4061AZJLR,Milder winters favor its spread,"The general increase in temperature Due to the climate crisis It favors the transmission of West Nile Virus (WNV) in some areas of Europe, where conditions are more favorable to the spread of viruses and mosquitoes that transmit them.
This warned against a study conducted by the Institute of Environmental Sciences and Technologies of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (ICTA-UAB), which analyzes the various causes that the West Nile virus has emerged recently, such as: health problem in Europe due to its rapid spread. In addition, the study's scientists warned that the virus would spread further north in Europe due to the warmer climate.

West Nile virus is a zoonosis generally transmitted by vectors It is transmitted between birds and mosquitoesHus, horses and other mammals can be infected, but they cannot transmit it. Can infection in man Be serious It causes neurological diseases and even death.
Until recently, WNV has only occasionally been reported in Europe and the virus is believed to have entered the continent through infected migratory birds in sub-Saharan Africa. This study was published in the journal A HealthPensa answering the question why the disease has become very common in Europe recently.
Thus, it processes and analyzes data from 166 regions from southern and southeastern Europe collected over a 13-year period, which highlights climate change, land use patterns, economic changes and central government spending in areas such as sanitation and the environment.
According to Matthew Watts, the study's principal investigator, there is no simple explanation to describe the recent increase in WNV, but rather a number of causes.
warmer winter
Typically, the climate is warmer in spring and summer due to the climate crisis It makes the conditions more favorable for the virus and its vectors than mosquitoes.
The researcher pointed out that warmer winters probably allowed infected domestic mosquitoes (Culex pipiens) to survive the winter in previously very cold regions (e.g. northern Italy); Therefore, the virus can now survive if Mosquitoes resist winter It spread at the beginning of the year.
The results confirmed that areas with a higher proportion of wetlands and arable land, including irrigated agriculture that tend to attract sensitive birds and mosquito species, are more susceptible to disease.
According to Watts, ""Without a doubt, changing other types of irrigation land uses will increase the risk of disease."" Drought Epidemics can also intensify, as the reduction of water resources leads to the convergence of mosquitoes and birds and an increase in potential cases of infection. Transmission and spread of the virus, which can then spread to humans.
The study also revealed that the countries that recorded the highest number of VNO cases During the analyzed period, were also those that applied the most significant reductions in environmental protection And sanitation expenses that could have benefited the presence of mosquitoes and viruses.

XQK8YPYKJV,"where it is, the risks and how to defend yourself","It colonized in a very short time before the Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, to arrive more recently to touch the Trentino Alto Adige: the Aedes japonicus, known as the Japanese mosquito, could soon become a problem for the countryside of Northern Italy and beyond.
Native to Southeast Asia, the insect is in fact particularly aggressive and is among the hundred most invasive species ever, including plants. It is also a species potentially capable of carrying diseases such as West Nile or Dengue fever, which is why experts recommend some attention. The mosquito that comes from the EastReported for the first time in Italy in 2015, the Japanese mosquito has made its way into our country starting from Carnia Friulana, on the border with Austria, to spread subsequently in the foothills of the region and arrive today to lap different areas of Veneto.As reported by the Istituto Zooprofilattico delle Venezie, it is a species extremely resistant to cold climates,  which is why its presence was already known in the mountain areas of Switzerland, Austria, Germany and Slovenia.Si is a particularly aggressive insect to be kept under control: as recalled by the veterinary doctor of the Edmund Mach Foundation, Annapaola Rizzoli, it is the ""third most invasive species in the world among mosquitoes"".

Like the tiger mosquito, it stings even in daylight hours and is quite annoying. It adapts incredibly well to urban environments, despite being a typically mountain species, and experts fear that it may intensify its presence in the semi-rural areas of the northeast, including urban centers. How to defend yourself from the Japanese mosquitoThe Istituto Zooprofilattico delle Venezie has recently invited citizens to report the presence of mosquitoes larger than normal to the health authorities: being a species capable of conveying potentially serious diseases and therefore considered dangerous, it is of absolute importance to monitor the presence of Aedes japonicus in the affected areas. As Stated by Professor Fabrizio Montarsi of the Zooprophylactic Institute of Padua on the columns of Repubblica, Japanese encephalitis has never been found in Europe; on the other hand, it is the greatest danger to which the presence of the annoying Japanese insect could expose us."" For the virus to be transmitted"", continues Montarsi, ""it is necessary that there are the insect, the virus and the exact same environment in which this transmission is possible, typically that of Southeast Asia"". There would seem to be no health danger on the horizon, but experts are monitoring and analyzing with the utmost attention the spread of the mosquito in the northeast. To defend yourself from any infestations near your home, meanwhile, the good practices are always the same: avoid stagnation of water, even in saucers, and do not stack materials in outdoor areas – especially if you live in the countryside and near waterways. The use of mosquito nets and compliance with good hygiene practices are fundamental: it seems that the Japanese mosquito is not only extremely resistant to the autumn climate and long distances, but even that it loves to thrive inside containers and pots with stagnant water.",https://initalia.virgilio.it/zanzara-giapponese-italia-dove-rischi-come-difendersi-51823,EN,IT,2022-03-25 13:44:28,2021-09-27 08:26:08+00:00,Relevant (m),General information (m),

4CMUE831LO,7 deaths and 56 West Nile virus infections in Greece [ECDC report],"7 deaths and 56 West Nile virus infections in Greece [ECDC report]

Seven people have lost their lives in our country this year, following infection with West Nile virus. A total of 56 infections have been reported, of which one last week.
This is mentioned, among other things, in the weekly epidemiological bulletin of the European Agency for Disease Prevention (ECDC), which runs until the end of last week (29 October).
The bulletin notes that, between 22 and 28 October, a case of West Nile virus infection was reported in the European Union, which was detected in Greece. From those neighbouring the European Union, no case or death from the virus was reported at that time.
From the beginning of the year until 28 October, 136 virus infections have been reported throughout the European Union and the countries of the European Economic Zone, of which 56 concern Greece, 54 italy, 7 Hungary, 7 Romania, 6 Spain, 3 Austria and 3 Germany.
In the ten months of the year, 7 people have died after infection in Greece, 1 in Spain and 1 in Romania. 3 deaths have also been reported in Serbia.
According to experts of the National Public Health Organization (EODY), West Nile virus is transmitted mainly by the bite of infected ""common"" mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are infected by infected birds (some species of mainly wild birds), while people who are infected do not further transmit the virus to other mosquitoes.
The majority of people infected with the virus do not get sick at all or have only mild disease, while few people (<1% of those infected) have a serious disease that affects the nervous system (mainly encephalitis or meningitis). Older people (over 50 years of age) are more at risk of becoming seriously ill, as well as people with immunosuppression and chronic underlying diseases.

A case of West Nile bosom, which was confirmed laboratory, was detected on a horse in a neighboring area of the Regional Unit of Lefkada.
West Nile disease is due to a virus and its reservoir in nature are various species of wild birds. The disease is transmitted by bites of infected mosquitoes to other birds and animals, among which are equidae, and humans report the thesstoday.gr.
The disease is not transmitted directly and by simple contact from equidae to humans.
For the prevention of the disease in equidae, it is recommended to apply insect repellents to animals, vaccinate them and insecticides in the stables.
Symptoms
The symptoms observed in sick horses are:

Anorexia, depression, fever (not always)
Nervous symptoms (are of particular importance):
Unnecessary wandering, depression, convulsions, staggering (instability in walking- ataxia), circular movements, myoclonies (often in the head-neck muscles and the rest of the body), inability to swallow, paralysis of the tongue, weakness of the limbs, partial paralysis sometimes up to complete paralysis, visual-hearing disorders, head pressure movements, teeth grinding.

Even during last year's period, the probability of severe disease from the virus for the country's permanent population was small (about 2 patients per 100,000 population).  Therefore, this probability for visitors to our country is estimated to be extremely low, in proportion to the length of their stay in the country, even in areas where circulation of the virus is recorded.",https://www.ethnos.gr/health/article/45561/ethnikosorganismosdhmosiasygeiaskanenakroysmatoyioytoydytikoyneiloysthnellada,EN,EL,2022-05-31 15:03:17,2021-11-01 23:02:09+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),
F0K98U8JP8,"West Nile virus. Symptoms of infection, transmitted by mosquitoes","West Nile virus. Symptoms of infection, transmitted by mosquitoes

80% of people infected with West Nile Virus remain asymptomatic, 20% have mild disease, while fewer than 1 in 100 patients have a serious clinical disease affecting the central nervous system.

by Cleopatra Zoubourli, molecular biologist, medlabnews.gr iatrikanea
West Nile virus (DN) is transmitted by a bite of infected mosquitoes. The main reservoir of the virus in nature is birds, while humans and mammals are considered as dead-end hosts, since the titer of the virus in their blood, during viremia, is low and not sufficient for mosquito infection. 

The majority of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, about 20% show mild symptoms of flu-like illness, and less than 1% show more severe manifestations than the central nervous system, mainly encephalitis, meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis.
The most severe manifestations usually occur in older people (>50 years), immunocompromised patients and generally people with chronic underlying diseases.
Epidemiological surveillance, a systematic and timely mosquito control program and informing the public about protection from mosquitoes are internationally the most important measures for the prevention of the disease.

In the summer-autumn of 2010, an epidemic of west Nile virus infection appeared for the first time in Greece in the region of Central Macedonia. Since then, cases of West Nile virus infection are recorded annually - every summer and autumn - in Greece, in humans and animals.
In 2011 the virus spread further south to Thessaly and Eastern Attica. In 2012, two main epicenters of the epidemic were recorded, in Attica (southern suburbs) and in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (mainly in the Regional Units of Xanthi and Kavala, around the Nestos River), while in 2013 two main epicenters were also recorded, in Attica (northern suburbs and Eastern Attica) and in the same areas of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. These years of cases were also recorded in Central Macedonia and Western Greece, as well as on some islands. In 2014, few cases of the infection were recorded, compared to the previous years, in the Rhodope Region, a new area of circulation of the virus, but also in areas of known circulation of the virus from previous years (P.E. xanthi, Eastern Attica, Ilia). In the years 2015 and 2016, no human cases of the infection were recorded in Greece. 

What are the symptoms of West Nile virus infection?
80% of people infected remain asymptomatic, 20% have mild disease, while fewer than 1 in 100 patients have a serious clinical disease that affects the central nervous system.

Asymptomatic infection: 80% (4 out of 5) of people infected do not manifest any symptoms.

Mild disease: It is estimated that about 20% of those infected with the virus develop mild symptoms, such as fever, headache, weakness, muscle and joint pains, vomiting and sometimes skin rashes (on the trunk) and swollen lymph nodes. Symptoms leave in 4-7 days without leaving any residue.

Severe disease: Less than 1 in 100 people (mostly older people) develop the severe form of the disease (encephalitis/meningitis). Symptoms of severe disease include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, apathy, disorientation, coma, tremor, convulsions, muscle weakness and paralysis.

Small but useful secrets for mosquitoes

Prefer light clothes with long sleeves and avoid the intense aromas that attract mosquitoes
do not leave overnight food out of the refrigerator or open bags of garbage inside the house
water, especially when it stagnates, is a pole of attraction for mosquitoes, so do not leave containers of water inside the house or on the terrace and be sure to change the water in flower pots often

Avoid coatings on children's skin with chemical insect repellents as well as perfumes, lotions or other cosmetic products because mosquitoes are attracted to pleasant odors as well as bright colors and sweat. The mosquito bite leaves a slight feeling of tingling on the skin while the ""controversial"" spot quickly blushes and slightly swells. At the same time, the known itching (itching) begins to trouble the victim of the mosquito. Mosquitoes also leave some of their own proteins in the place where they sting which create all the problems

antihistamines: we administer for a few days antihistamines to relieve the patient from severe itching and reduce the allergic reaction to the bite;
corticosteroids: local corticosteroids administered for a short time are useful especially in pronounced itchy inflammatory lesions;
antimicrobial agents: if there is a secondary",https://medlabgr.blogspot.com/2013/07/blog-post_17.html,EN,EL,2022-04-14 03:17:14,2021-08-02 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

RGNJ8NF1PU,West Nile virus still... sleeps - Lower the level of nuisance from mosquitoes compared to other years,"West Nile virus still... sleeps - Lower the level of nuisance from mosquitoes compared to other years

Central Macedonia seems to be going through the mildest year in terms of mosquito nuisance, as even settlements around the rice fields in Thessaloniki and Serres do not seem to have been affected, as was the case in previous years, especially during the difficult period of July. 
At the same time, the fact that at this stage there is no circulation of West Nile virus is positive, as evidenced by the blood donations already completed in young chickens in 50 villages of the region, while at the same time very low mosquito populations are recorded throughout Central Macedonia, which is attributed to the scant rainfall.
Scientists are talking about unprecedented data, reaching a decade-long level, as July was the month when the nuisance hit ""red"", forcing citizens in many areas to stay home, while the first case of West Nile virus began to be recorded.
""However, we are alert and at a good level of alertness, as the very high temperatures worry us about possible outbreaks of West Nile virus. At this stage, however, the circulation of the virus is zero, which means a reduced epidemiological risk"", stressed makthes.gr the president and CEO of the company ""Eco-development"" Dr. Spyros Mourelatos who is in charge of the spraying program in Central Macedonia. 
He explained that there is a standby, because the situation due to the continuing high temperatures can change at any time and in case there are heavy rains, the nuisance from mosquitoes will increase significantly. ""But especially on the issue of the circulation of the virus, which worries every year the health authorities and the citizens, we will have an overall picture and we will draw a safe conclusion when at the end of July the second cycle of blood donations to young chickens is completed"", he pointed out.
He also added that if the mercury had not hit ""red"" at this time, then scientifically one could have spoken of a period of very low epidemiological risk.
This year we are reviewing... even in paddy fields
According to Mr. Mourelatos, another encouraging element is that this year the nuisance is extremely low in areas adjacent to paddy fields in Thessaloniki and Seerres, where of the approximately 80 settlements, it seems that only 5-10 are affected. 
""This means that only in them is the level of nuisance relatively high, which leads us to revise downwards and say that these are unprecedented data over a decade"", underlined the president of the company ""Eco-development"".
He even mentioned that the low nuisance concerns both day and night, i.e. from 8.30 in the morning until 10.30 in the evening onwards, where the same levels are recorded. 
Mr. Mourelatos referring to the reasons that contributed to this are the few rainfalls that occurred, but also the full development of sprayings from the ground since last April, and from the air since the beginning of June, in which 40 crews are operating in the seven prefectures of Central Macedonia.
However, scientists and health authorities in CCM remain on alert for the possibility of west Nile virus outbreaks, warning that low nuisance does not mean eliminating the epidemiological risk. ""Smaller mosquito populations do not mean a low level of epidemiological risk"", commented Mr. Mourelatos, explaining that in any case public health has priority and for this reason the surveillance is continuous.

From 10 p.m. to 12 midnight on Thursday, the residents of Eleousa, in the Municipality of Chalkidona, a few kilometers west of the city of Thessaloniki, were asked to close in their homes, with ""sealed"" doors and windows. The housewives gathered the outstretched clothes, the beekeepers removed the hives, the pets entered the interior of the houses, while some covered the vegetable gardens in their yards with nylon, although the instructions indicated that the products could be consumed the next day, after washing. During these two hours, crews of the Public Health Directorate of the Region of Central Macedonia carried out extensive sprayings throughout the settlement to combat mosquitoes, following the detection of a case of West Nile virus in a resident.
It was the third case in the prefecture of Thessaloniki this season, 34th in Central Macedonia and 41st in Greece.
The disease, which is transmitted to humans through infected common mosquitoes, with wild birds as the intermediate host, is asymptomatic in almost 80% of cases, and for this reason, cases that manifest symptoms are mainly detected. Two out of ten who will be infected will experience mild symptoms, while in a percentage of less than 1% the virus causes severe manifestations in the Central Nervous System, leading some of them to death. Particularly vulnerable are people of advanced age and especially those who have underlying serious diseases.

Since 2010 in Greece
The virus, which has spread to different parts of the world and is endemic to the U.S., first appeared in Europe in 1996, with an epidemic wave mainly in Romania. A few years later it was also detected in Greece.
According to the epidemiological surveillance carried out by EODY, from 2010 to 2014 and from 2017 until today, dozens to hundreds of cases are recorded every year, while in the intermediate period 2015-2016 no cases were confirmed.
A total of 1,402 confirmed cases have been recorded in our country, of which 1,003 with an attack of the Central Nervous System and 196 deaths.
The period of recording cases coincides with that of mosquito circulation, with an outbreak in the four months of July – October.
This year, until September 7th, 40 cases have been confirmed, of which 30 have been confirmed with an attack of the Central Nervous System, while 3 people have passed away.

**Included is an incident that was infected in 2018 but was diagnosed in 2019.
It includes a death of a hospitalized patient who became infected in 2018 and ended up in 2019.
Central Macedonia in the spotlight
The vast majority of cases, as every year, are found in the prefectures of Central Macedonia, while the dispersion includes sporadic cases in other regions of the country.
Of the 40 cases that have been recorded in the reports of the National Public Health Organization until September 7 (s.p. increased to 41 with the case of Eleousa Thessaloniki), 33 are located in Central Macedonia, of which 15 in the prefectures of Pella and Imathia, 2 in Thessaloniki and 1 in Serres. Another 2 cases have been identified in Eastern Attica (one in the municipalities of Pallini and Spata - Artemis), 2 in Central Greece (from 1 in Boeotia and Evia) and 2 in Eastern Macedonia (from 1 in Kavala and Drama).
Regarding the condition of the 40 people who have been confirmed infected during the current period, 5 patients are hospitalized, 4 of them in ICU, while another 29 have been discharged.

How it is transmitted - Precautionary measures
West Nile virus is transmitted mainly through the bite of infected ""common"" mosquitoes. The main reservoir of the virus in nature is mainly wild birds, from where mosquitoes are infected, while people do not further transmit the virus to other mosquitoes. The majority of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic, about 20% have mild symptoms of viral syndrome (fever, headache, exanthesis",https://www.iatronet.gr/article/103476/ios-dytikoy-neiloy-41-kroysmata-eos-tora-3-thanatoi-4-sthn-entatikh,EN,EL,2022-04-14 03:17:14,2021-09-10 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),Outbreak declaration (m),

The Department of Veterinary Medicine of Lefkada informs that in a neighboring area of the P.E. of Lefkada, a case of West Nile Disease appeared in a horse, which was confirmed in a laboratory.
West Nile disease is due to a virus and its reservoir in nature are various species of wild birds. The disease is transmitted by bites of infected mosquitoes to other birds and animals, among which are equidae and humans. The disease is NOT transmitted directly and by simple contact from equidae to humans.
For the prevention of the disease in equidae, it is recommended to apply insect repellents to animals, vaccinate them and insecticides in the stables.
The symptoms observed in equidae suffering from West Nile Disease are:
• General symptoms:
Anorexia, depression, fever (not always)
• Nervous symptoms ( are of particular importance):
Unnecessary wandering, depression, convulsions, staggering (instability in walking- ataxia), circular movements, myoclonies (often in the head-neck muscles and the rest of the body), inability to swallow, paralysis of the tongue, weakness of the limbs, partial paralysis sometimes up to complete paralysis, visual-hearing disorders, head pressure movements, teeth grinding.
• Coma in the final stage and death
Owners of equidae are kindly requested to systematically monitor the health status of the animals and if they find out the existence of any of the above symptoms, to contact immediately the Department of Veterinary Medicine of Lefkada at the telephone numbers 2645360752
and 2645360740. The disease is a MANDATORY DECLARATION, and failure to do so is subject to administrative and criminal penalties.
On this occasion we emphasize that all equine holders are obliged to DECLARE the animals they keep (horses, semi-donkeys and donkeys) and their changes (purchase, sale, birth, death) to the Veterinary Service of the P.E. of Lefkada.",https://www.ypaithros.gr/krousma-nosou-dytikou-neilou-ippo-geitoniki-perioxi-pe-leykadas/,EN,EL,2022-04-19 16:44:32,2021-11-03 06:00:00+00:00,Relevant (m),"Alert, prepardness (m)",
